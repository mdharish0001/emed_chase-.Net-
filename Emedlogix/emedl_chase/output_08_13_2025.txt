LDL-C is now calculated using the Martin-Hopkins
calculation, which is a validated novel method providing
better accuracy than the Friedewald equation in the
estimation of LDL-C.

As recommended by the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA), all samples with positive or equivocal
results in a Borrelia burgdorferi antibody screen
will be tested using a blot method. Positive or
equivocal screening test results should not be
interpreted as truly positive until verified as such
using a supplemental assay (e.g., B. burgdorferi blot).
The screening test and/or blot for B. burgdorferi
antibodies may be falsely negative in early stages
of Lyme disease, including the period when erythema
migrans is apparent.

We will arrange for routine blood work
on today's visit for assessment of overall health as well as apolipoprotein B
and lipoprotein A for assessment of genetic predisposition to hyperlipidemia.
Given his complaints of fatigue and history of syncope in the past, we will
arrange for echocardiogram and EKG on today's visit. Preliminary images were
reviewed and discussed revealing a preserved ejection fraction of 55% to 60%
with mild TR noted. We will arrange for an ETT as well for further ischemic
evaluation of shortness of breath on exertion. Given syncopal episodes in the
past and complaints of migraines, we will arrange for a carotid doppler on
today's visit. Preliminary images were reviewed and discussed which revealed
trace atherosclerotic disease. We will arrange for an ABI/PVR given decreased
pedal pulses on physical examination revealing an RLE of 1.27 and an LLE of
1.28. We will arrange for an event monitor to be placed on today's visit given
history of syncopal episodes in the past. We will be referring him to
ophthalmology for an eye exam as he is not up-to-date and complaints of
migraines. We will also arrange for an MRI of the brain without contrast given
his hand tremors and migraines. All questions and concerns were answered and
addressed. Heart healthy diet and healthy lifestyle encouraged and endorsed. He
is to follow up on Friday or sooner should symptoms worsen. He agrees to the
plan of care.
Time Spent:
 Total time spent 85 minutes.  More than 50% of the time spent in
face-to-face conversation, examination, discussing treatment options and
procedures, pathophysiology, and anatomy. Diet and lifestyle modifications were
discussed in great detail.  Images were personally reviewed by me in front
of the patient and/or family member and explained on our graphic diagram.
 Treatment options, risks, benefits and alternative treatments discussed
with the patient in detail. All questions and concerns answered.  All
records were reviewed in detail

Other
Given his persistent exertional dyspnea, he underwent an exercise treadmill test at today's visit to further evaluate for possible underlying cardiovascular disease or exercise-induced arrhythmias. He was able to demonstrate good exercise capacity throughout the study. Results will be formally reviewed and discussed with him at his next follow-up visit. All questions and concerns answered and addressed. Heart healthy diet and healthy lifestyle modifications were encouraged and endorsed. He will follow up in one week to review the official results of the ETT. He was advised to return sooner if symptoms worsen or new concerns arise. He agrees with the plan of care.

History and Physical Notes

HPI (History of Present Illness)

08/13/2025
Transition of Care
This is a 23-year-old male, non-smoker, referred by ZocDoc with a significant medical history of renal calculi, migraines as well as syncope, who presents today for initial CV consultation for an annual physical. He currently works as the kitchen staff with elderly care in Fishkill. He has no children and lives in Wappingers. He has not seen a PCP in the last 2 years. He has a significant family history of pancreatic cancer in his maternal grandmother. He has a past surgical history of appendectomy. He reports that his last episode of syncope was several years ago and he was diagnosed officially with vasovagal syncope at that time. He reports not exercising as much as he would like to, but tries to maintain a balanced diet and a regular sleep schedule. He is overall feeling well but has noted severe migraines developing over the last months. He also complains of hand tremors. He complains of mild shortness of breath and fatigue. He denies any active chest pain, chest pressure, syncope, or near-syncopal events.
  Echocardiogram: Preserved ejection fraction of 55% to 60% with mild TR noted. 
  Carotid doppler: Trace atherosclerotic disease. 
  ABI/PVR: RLE of 1.27 and LLE of 1.28. 
  We will arrange for routine blood work on today's visit for assessment of overall health as well as apolipoprotein B and lipoprotein A for assessment of genetic predisposition to hyperlipidemia. Given his complaints of fatigue and history of syncope in the past, we will arrange for echocardiogram and EKG on today's visit. Preliminary images were reviewed and discussed revealing a preserved ejection fraction of 55% to 60% with mild TR noted. We will arrange for an ETT as well for further ischemic evaluation of shortness of breath on exertion. Given syncopal episodes in the past and complaints of migraines, we will arrange for a carotid doppler on today's visit. Preliminary images were reviewed and discussed which revealed trace atherosclerotic disease. We will arrange for an ABI/PVR given decreased pedal pulses on physical examination revealing an RLE of 1.27 and an LLE of 1.28. We will arrange for an event monitor to be placed on today's visit given history of syncopal episodes in the past. We will be referring him to ophthalmology for an eye exam as he is not up-to-date and complaints of migraines. We will also arrange for an MRI of the brain without contrast given his hand tremors and migraines. All questions and concerns were answered and addressed. Heart healthy diet and healthy lifestyle encouraged and endorsed. He is to follow up on Friday or sooner should symptoms worsen. He agrees to the plan of care

Transition of Care
This is a 23-year-old male, non-smoker, with a significant medical history of renal calculi, migraines as well as syncope, who presents today for CV follow-up with primary complaints of shortness of breath. He reports exertional shortness of breath that limits his exercise tolerance, though he denies dyspnea at rest. He also denies any active chest pain, chest pressure, shortness of breath, syncope or near syncopal events.
  Echocardiogram: Preserved ejection fraction of 55% to 60% with mild TR noted. 
  Carotid doppler: Trace atherosclerotic disease. 
  ABI/PVR: RLE of 1.27 and LLE of 1.28. 
Given his persistent exertional dyspnea, he underwent an exercise treadmill test at today's visit to further evaluate for possible underlying cardiovascular disease or exercise-induced arrhythmias. He was able to demonstrate good exercise capacity throughout the study. Results will be formally reviewed and discussed with him at his next follow-up visit. All questions and concerns answered and addressed. Heart healthy diet and healthy lifestyle modifications were encouraged and endorsed. He will follow up in one week to review the official results of the ETT. He was advised to return sooner if symptoms worsen or new concerns arise. He agrees with the plan of care.
