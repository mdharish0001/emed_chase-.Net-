Laboratory

findings revealed A1C of 5.7, suggesting borderline prediabetes, and

LDL level of 123, indicating mildly elevated cholesterol. Thyroid

function panel, CMP, and vitamin D levels were all within normal

limits. We advised the patient to continue a heart-healthy diet and

to limit intake of complex carbohydrates to reduce progression to

diabetes. She was encouraged to maintain physical activity and

hydration. Given her lab trends, lifestyle interventions are

justified and medically necessary to prevent escalation to chronic

conditions. All questions and concerns answered and addressed. Heart

healthy diet and healthy lifestyle modifications were encouraged and

endorsed. Patient agreed with the plan of care.

 Patient was informed of the telemedicine visit by our office staff. Telemedicine was described in detail to the patient as the use of synchronous video and audio communication to provide clinical care from a distance. A telemedicine visit can provide the same medical standard of care for specific conditions. The patient was informed that the practice staff located at the provider's office would assist in carrying out any recommendations and clinical care.

Patient Location: Home

Lack of strict HIPPA Rules. Patient expressed verbal interest in the telemedicine visit and granted consent to proceed.
