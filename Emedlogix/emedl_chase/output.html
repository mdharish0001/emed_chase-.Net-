<p>We reviewed and discussed the results of her recent labs. Her B12 levels, although normal, were on the low end in the 200s. We will administer B12 1000 mcg SC to the left arm for her fatigue. Side effects discussed. She was advised to continue to follow with Dr. Koren, ophthalmology. We will also discontinue her Singulair as she was having side effects and start her on Xyzal 5 mg daily. Side effects were discussed. For her leg swelling and associated ache with known venous insufficiency, we will also arrange for venous ablation therapy, which we will arrange in two weeks' time. Risks, benefits and alternatives were discussed in the great detail. She reports she is depending a colonoscopy with her new gastroenterologist in Sleepy Hollow on 08/05. We discussed the importance of compliance. She was advised to maintain a healthy diet and healthy lifestyle. We will see her back for venous ablation therapy in two weeks or sooner if symptoms arise. She agrees with the plan of care.</p>
<p>The patient was monitored for over 15 minutes post procedure. The patient was evaluated for any adverse or allergic reaction. Vital signs remained stable. No indication of any adverse reaction to the site or to any allergic reaction. Blood pressure remained stable.</p>

<p>Transition of Care</p>
<p>This is a 63-year-old female, former smoker, with a history of asthma, anemia, HLD, hypothyroidism and anxiety, who presents today for a cardiovascular follow-up for fatigue and leg swelling. She recently followed with Dr. Koren, ophthalmologist, for her eyes and was provided with eyedrops for bilateral ptosis, which has been ongoing. She also reports intermittent leg swelling along with associated fatigue. She reports her Singulair was making her angry and giving her mood disturbances, so she discontinued it on her own. She is looking for an alternative to Singulair. She additionally complains of intermittent fatigue. She complains of leg swelling at times as well. She denies any chest pain, chest pressure, shortness of breath, syncope or near-syncopal events.</p>
<p>Venous reflux study: Significant reflux in bilateral GSV</p>
<p>Echocardiogram: LVEF 55-60%, mild pulmonary hypertension with PASP of 30 mmHg.</p>
<p>BLE arterial doppler: Significant stenosis with possible infrapopliteal bilateral stenosis.</p>
<p>Carotid doppler:  Mild plaque.</p>
<p>AAA screen: Mild-to-moderate plaque, no significant evidence of abdominal uretic aneurysm.</p>
<p>Peripheral angiogram; 02/12/25; right femoral artery access revealing RSFA 40% stenosis and LSFA 50% stenosis.</p>
<p>BLE arterial doppler: Patent flow.</p>
<p>Venous reflux:  Mild reflux and no significant DVT.</p>
<p>We reviewed and discussed the results of her recent labs. Her B12 levels, although normal, were on the low end in the 200s. We will administer B12 1000 mcg SC to the left arm for her fatigue. Side effects discussed. She was advised to continue to follow with Dr. Koren, ophthalmology. We will also discontinue her Singulair as she was having side effects and start her on Xyzal 5 mg daily. Side effects were discussed. For her leg swelling and associated ache with known venous insufficiency, we will also arrange for venous ablation therapy, which we will arrange in two weeks' time. Risks, benefits and alternatives were discussed in the great detail. She reports she is depending a colonoscopy with her new gastroenterologist in Sleepy Hollow on 08/05. We discussed the importance of compliance. She was advised to maintain a healthy diet and healthy lifestyle. All questions and concerns were answered and addressed. We will see her back for venous ablation therapy in two weeks or sooner if symptoms arise. She agrees with the plan of care.</p>
