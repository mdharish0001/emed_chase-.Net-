We will arrange for coronary stress testing with Lexiscan at his next visit for further ischemic evaluation of his shortness of breath on exertion. Risks, benefits, and alternatives to the diagnostic study were discussed in great detail. He complains of shortness of breath on exertion, and we will arrange for an echocardiogram at today's visit and discuss the results at his next visit. He was encouraged to continue wearing compression socks during the day and to rest and elevate his legs at night, given his complaints of heaviness, aching, and swelling in his lower extremities and the finding of venous insufficiency at his last visit. All questions and concerns were answered and addressed. A heart-healthy diet and healthy lifestyle were encouraged and endorsed. He will follow up in 1 week or sooner if symptoms arise. He agrees to the plan of care.

For
further ischemic evaluation of his shortness of breath on exertion, we will
arrange for coronary stress testing with Lexiscan on today's visit. Risks,
benefits, and alternatives to the diagnostic study were discussed in great
detail. We will review and discuss the results at his next follow up. Given his
finding of thyroid nodule on carotid doppler, we will arrange for a dedicated
thyroid nodule at a future visit. Thyroid nodule measured 0.8 cm consistent
with TIRADS score of 2/3. We discussed repeating thyroid ultrasound in 6 months
for further surveillance. We will review and discuss the results at his next
visit. All questions and concerns were answered and addressed. Heart healthy
diet and healthy lifestyle encouraged and endorsed. He is to follow up in 1
week or sooner should symptoms worsen. He agrees to the plan of care

This is a 76-year-old male with significant medical history who presents today for CV follow up for shortness of breath. He continues to complain of shortness of breath on exertion, unchanged from his last visit. He was also found to have thyroid nodules on carotid doppler at a prior visit. We had discussed evaluation with a dedicated thyroid ultrasound. He denies any chest pain, chest pressure, syncope or near-syncopal events.
For further ischemic evaluation of his shortness of breath on exertion, we will arrange for coronary stress testing with Lexiscan on today's visit.

This is a 76-year-old male with significant medical history who presents today for CV follow-up for shortness of breath. He continues to complain of shortness of breath on exertion, which is unchanged from his last complaints. He also complains of lower extremity heaviness and aching and was found to have significant venous reflux at a prior visit. He denies any active chest pain, chest pressure, syncope, or near syncopal events.
