This assay result is consistent with a decreased risk
of diabetes.
Currently, no consensus exists regarding use of
hemoglobin A1c for diagnosis of diabetes in children.
According to American Diabetes Association (ADA)
guidelines, hemoglobin A1c <7.0% represents optimal
control in non-pregnant diabetic patients. Different
metrics may apply to specific patient populations.
Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes(ADA).
This test was performed on the Roche cobas c503 platform.
Effective 4/16/24, a change in test platforms from the
Abbott Architect to the Roche cobas c503 may have shifted
HbA1c results compared to historical results.
Based on laboratory validation testing conducted at
Quest, the Roche platform relative to the Abbott
platform had an average increase in HbA1c value of
< or = 0.3%. This difference is within accepted
variability established by the National Glycohemoglobin
Standardization Program. Note that not all individuals
will have had a shift in their results and direct
comparisons between historical and current results for
testing conducted on different platforms is not
recommended.

We will consider increasing her HCTZ if her BP remains elevated at the next visit. Given her strong family history of coronary artery disease and exertional SOB we will arrange for further ischemic evaluation with coronary stress testing. She is pending CT of the thyroid without contrast for further evaluation of thyroid nodules found on carotid doppler. She was advised to maintain a healthy lifestyle and increase her activity and hydration. All questions and concerns were answered and addressed. She agrees with the plan of care.

She has significant reticular varicose veins to her bilateral lower extremities causing significant heaviness and achiness since the past few weeks. Since the past few months she has been compliant on compression stockings with minimal symptomatic relief.  Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, SOB, blurred or double vision, syncope or near syncopal events. Denies any family history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden cardiac death.
Today I am going to arrange for an ABI/PVR as she has more than 60 pack/year smoking history. If her ABIs are normal we will arrange for arterial doppler at the next visit. For her reticular, varicose, and spider veins I am going to arrange for a BLE venous reflux study. For her dizziness I am going to arrange for a carotid doppler as well.

She is tolerating tirzepatide well. We will continue with her current dose today. Tirzepatide 15 mg was administered SC to the right arm without complication. She understands that the long-term side effects of tirzepatide are not well known. She also understands the importance of ongoing caloric deficit for optimal weight reduction. We discussed increasing her hydration and her activity levels as well. She is eating a lot less but reports not having changed her eating habits. We discussed not just counting on the shots and instead maintaining diet modification, increasing her protein and vegetable intake, and decreasing her intake of processed and carbohydrate-rich foods. Zepbound was previously sent to her pharmacy but was not approved by her insurance. She would like to continue receiving the injections in our office. A heart-healthy diet and healthy lifestyle modifications were encouraged and endorsed. All questions and concerns were answered and addressed to complete understanding and satisfaction. We will see her back in 1 week or sooner, should symptoms arise. She agrees to the plan of care.
