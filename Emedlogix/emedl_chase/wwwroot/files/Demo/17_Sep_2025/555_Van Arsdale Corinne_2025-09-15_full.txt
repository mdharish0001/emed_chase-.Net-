This assay result is consistent with a decreased risk
of diabetes.
Currently, no consensus exists regarding use of
hemoglobin A1c for diagnosis of diabetes in children.
According to American Diabetes Association (ADA)
guidelines, hemoglobin A1c <7.0% represents optimal
control in non-pregnant diabetic patients. Different
metrics may apply to specific patient populations.

NOT DETECTED
Antimicrobials, proton pump inhibitors, and bismuth
preparations are known to suppress H. pylori, and
ingestion of these prior to H. pylori diagnostic testing
may lead to false negative results. If clinically
indicated, the test may be repeated on a new specimen
obtained two weeks after discontinuing treatment.
However, a positive result is still clinically valid.

On physical examination, the patient is
normotensive with a blood pressure of 115/70 and a heart rate of 83. It is also
noted that she has 3 surgical incisions consistent with her 3-point
laparoscopic appendectomy that are without any evidence of infection. She is
also noted to have a soft depressible abdomen as well on physical examination.
She was strongly advised to increase her hydration and we will arrange for
routine blood work for assessment of overall health as well as amylase and
lipase given her abdominal complaints, apolipoprotein B and lipoprotein A for
assessment of genetic predisposition to hyperlipidemia, H. pylori given her
abdominal discomfort, B12, iron panel, folate and ferritin for evaluation of
rectal bleeding. We will sending her Anusol suppositories and cream in hopes of
improving her symptoms and MiraLax 17 g to be taken daily. Side effects were
discussed in great detail. We will be referring her to Dr. Lance Siegel, GI,
for possible hemorrhoid evaluation. All questions and concerns were answered
and addressed. Heart healthy diet and healthy lifestyle encouraged and
endorsed. She is to follow up in 1 week or sooner should symptoms worsen. She
agrees to the plan of care.
Time Spent:
Total time spent 89 minutes.  More than 50% of the time spent in
face-to-face conversation, examination, discussing treatment options and
procedures, pathophysiology, and anatomy. Diet and lifestyle modifications were
discussed in great detail.  Images were personally reviewed by me in front
of the patient and/or family member and explained on our graphic diagram.
Treatment options, risks, benefits and alternative treatments discussed
with the patient in detail. All questions and concerns answered.  All
records were reviewed in detail

Transition of Care
This is a 38-year-old female, non-smoker, rarely consumes alcohol, referred online with a significant medical history of obesity and anxiety, who presents today for initial CV consultation with complaints of rectal pain and pressure. She is self-employed as a wedding planner. She has no children and lives in Newburgh. Her PCP is Optum Health. She has a significant family history of hypertension in her father. She has a surgical history of recent appendectomy. She is currently managed with Lexapro 10 mg daily, which she tolerates well. She reports maintaining a balanced diet. She reports ongoing rectal pain and pressure prior to her being diagnosed with appendicitis approximately 2 weeks ago. She reports going to the ED for severe abdominal pain and bright red rectal bleeding and pain and was diagnosed with appendicitis and underwent laparoscopic appendectomy, which she reports to have tolerated well but has ongoing rectal pain and rectal bleeding. She complains of some burning and pressure as well and reports that the surgery was uneventful without any complication. She notes mild constipation and straining as well at times. She denies any active chest pain, chest pressure, syncope, or near-syncopal events.
On physical examination, the patient is normotensive with a blood pressure of 115/70 and a heart rate of 83. It is also noted that she has 3 surgical incisions consistent with her 3-point laparoscopic appendectomy that are without any evidence of infection. She is also noted to have a soft depressible abdomen as well on physical examination. She was strongly advised to increase her hydration and we will arrange for routine blood work for assessment of overall health as well as amylase and lipase given her abdominal complaints, apolipoprotein B and lipoprotein A for assessment of genetic predisposition to hyperlipidemia, H. pylori given her abdominal discomfort, B12, iron panel, folate and ferritin for evaluation of rectal bleeding.
