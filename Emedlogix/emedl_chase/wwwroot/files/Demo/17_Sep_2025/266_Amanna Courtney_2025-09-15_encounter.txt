Her
blood pressure is mildly elevated on today's visit with a blood pressure of
140/90 with a heart rate of 90 beats per minute. We will be refilling her
olmesartan for her at this time and advised to maintain compliance to her
antihypertensive regimen. We discussed arranging for repeat blood pressure
check at her next visit and possibly consider titrating her antihypertensive
regimen given her uncontrolled blood pressure. We reviewed and discussed her
prior echocardiogram, which was completed for shortness of breath on exertion
revealing an EF of 55%, trace AR, mild TR and trace MR. All questions and
concerns were answered and addressed. Heart healthy diet and healthy lifestyle
encouraged and endorsed. She is to follow up in 4 weeks or sooner should
symptoms worsen. She agrees to the plan of care
