<p>months without significant symptom relief, we will arrange for RGSV ablation</p>
<p>therapy on today's visit. Risks, benefits, and alternatives were discussed in great</p>
<p>detail. She tolerated the procedure well. She was encouraged to continue</p>
<p>wearing compression socks during the day, resting and elevating her legs at</p>

<p>Transition of Care</p>
<p>This is a 72-year-old female, former smoker, with significant medical history of HTN, HLD, venous insufficiency, and obesity, who presents today for CV follow up with leg pain. She continues to complain of lower extremity heaviness, aching and swelling as well as itching and burning at the sites of bulging varicosities. She is compliant with compression stocking therapy during the day, resting and elevating her legs at night but has not experienced significant symptom relief. She denies any active chest pain, chest pressure, syncope or near-syncopal events.</p>
<p>Carotid doppler: 50-69% bilateral ICA stenosis. Mild plaque seen in bilateral carotid plaque. Incidentally found thyroid nodule. Thyroid ultrasound with right and left lobe solid nodules, both of which are hypoechoic.</p>
<p>BLE venous reflux study. No evidence of DVT, significant bilateral GSV reflux</p>
<p>LAAV ablation 04/15/2024</p>
<p>Peripheral angiogram 04/04/2024, left anterior tibial artery access: Distal LSFA CTO, LPA 80% stenosis, severe anterior tibial artery stenosis, status post laser atherectomy of LSFA and popliteal artery status post balloon angioplasty of LSFA and 6 x 150 mm SMART stent overlapping with 6 x 100 mm stent deployed to left mid to distal SFA s/p laser atherectomy of left anterior tibial artery and balloon angioplasty of left anterior tibial artery as well.</p>
<p>LAASV ablation 04/15/2024</p>
<p>Peripheral angiogram, right anterior tibial artery access 05/09/2024: RSFA 90% stenosis, RPA 80% stenosis, RATA 90% stenosis, s/p laser atherectomy of RSFA and popliteal artery, balloon angioplasty of RSFA and popliteal artery, 6 x 100 mm SMART stent deployed to distal to mid RSFA, laser atherectomy of RATA and balloon angioplasty of RATA as well.</p>
<p>Echocardiogram: Preserved ejection fraction</p>
<p>BLE arterial doppler: Flow throughout</p>
<p>Peripheral angiogram, 08/05/24, left femoral artery access site: RSFA CTO, RPA 80% stenosis, RATA 70% stenosis S/P balloon angioplasty of RSFA and RATA.</p>
<p>RLE arterial doppler: Flow throughout</p>
<p>Renal artery ultrasound: No evidence of renal artery stenosis</p>
<p>ABI/PVR: RLE of 0.69 and LLE of 0.19.</p>
<p>BLE venous reflux study: Negative for any evidence of DVT but positive for BLE reflux</p>
<p>We reviewed and discussed her prior venous reflux exam which was negative for any evidence of DVT but positive for BLE reflux. Given her persistent lower extremity heaviness, aching and swelling despite compression stocking therapy for over 6 months without significant symptom relief, we will arrange for RGSV ablation therapy on today's visit. Risks, benefits, and alternatives were discussed in great detail. She tolerated the procedure well. She was encouraged to continue wearing compression socks during the day, resting and elevating her legs at night. All questions and concerns were answered and addressed. Heart healthy diet and healthy lifestyle encouraged and endorsed. She is to follow up in 1 week or sooner should symptoms arise. She agrees to the plan of care.</p>
