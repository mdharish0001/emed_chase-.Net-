Given
recent LSSV ablation, we will arrange for a venous doppler of the LLE.
Preliminary images were reviewed and discussed, which were negative for any
evidence of DVT. She complains of persistent lower extremity heaviness, aching
and swelling as well as itching and burning at the sites of bulging
varicosities despite compliance with compression socks during the day, resting
and elevating her legs at night. We will obtain authorization for
below-the-knee venous ablation. Risks, benefits, and alternatives were
discussed in great detail. We will obtain authorization as she has remained
compliant with compression socks during the day, resting and elevating her legs
at night without significant symptom relief for over 6 months. All questions
and concerns were answered and addressed. Heart healthy diet and healthy
lifestyle encouraged and endorsed. She is to follow up in 2 weeks or sooner
should symptoms worsen. She agrees to the plan of care
