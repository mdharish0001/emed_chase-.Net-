HEMOGLOBIN A1c
5.8
<5.7 %
For someone without known diabetes, a hemoglobin
A1c value between 5.7% and 6.4% is consistent with
prediabetes and should be confirmed with a
follow-up test.
For someone with known diabetes, a value <7%
indicates that their diabetes is well controlled. A1c
targets should be individualized based on duration of
diabetes, age, comorbid conditions, and other
considerations.
This assay result is consistent with an increased risk
of diabetes.
Currently, no consensus exists regarding use of
hemoglobin A1c for diagnosis of diabetes for children.

For further evaluation of shortness of
breath, we will arrange for EKG and echocardiogram today. Preliminary images
were reviewed and discussed revealing an ejection fraction of 55% with trivial
PB, mild MR and moderate TR. Given complaints of lightheadedness and dizziness,
we will arrange for a carotid doppler. Preliminary images were reviewed and
discussed revealing moderate atherosclerotic disease. Given finding of
decreased pedal pulses on physical examination, we will arrange for an ABI/PVR
revealing an RLE of 1.07 and an LLE of 1.24. We will arrange for BLE arterial
doppler at her next visit given her decreased pedal pulses found on physical
examination and complaints of lower extremity pain and discomfort. We will
arrange for BLE venous reflux exam on today's visit given lower extremity
heaviness and aching as well as intermittent edema. Preliminary images were
reviewed and discussed which were negative for any evidence of DVT but
bilateral significant reflux as well as edema noted. She remains compliant with
compression stocking therapy during the day, resting and elevating her legs at
night but has not experienced significant symptom relief. We provided the
patient with educational material on venous insufficiency as well as treatment
with venous ablation therapy and possible venogram. We will arrange for routine
blood work for assessment of overall health on today's visit which we will
review and discuss at her next follow up. She expressed concern of treatment
with combined pharmacological therapy with both metoprolol and diltiazem for
maximal control of her SVT. She completed a CTA of the thorax on 06/21/25 which
we reviewed and discussed today revealing severe pulmonary emphysema with
multiple solid pulmonary nodules in the left upper lobe measuring up to 5 mm.
We discussed further evaluation at a future follow up and possible biopsy. We
will also be referring her to Dr. Bezdicek, pulmonology, for further
evaluation. All questions and concerns were answered and addressed. Heart
healthy diet and healthy lifestyle encouraged and endorsed. She is to follow up
in 2 weeks or sooner should symptoms worsen. She agrees to the plan of care.
Time Spent:
Total time spent 88 minutes.  More than 50% of the time spent in
face-to-face conversation, examination, discussing treatment options and
procedures, pathophysiology, and anatomy. Diet and lifestyle modifications were
discussed in great detail.  Images were personally reviewed by me in front
of the patient and/or family member and explained on our graphic diagram.
Treatment options, risks, benefits and alternative treatments discussed
with the patient in detail. All questions and concerns answered.  All
records were reviewed in detail

Other
On
physical examination, the patient has lower extremity edema, worse in her RLE.
We will arrange for CDT of BLE on today's visit. Given her dissatisfaction with
her current pulmonology care, we will be referring her to Dr. Bezdicek and we
discussed further evaluation of her findings on recent chest x-ray and possible
biopsy should it be needed. We reviewed and discussed her routine labs
completed at her last visit revealing an LDL of 145, a hemoglobin A1c of 5.8,
and a normal thyroid panel. We will be initiating treatment for her
hyperlipidemia with Crestor 10 mg daily. She continues to complain of lower
extremity heaviness, aching and swelling despite compliance with compression
stocking therapy during the day, resting and elevating her legs at night
without significant symptom relief. We will arrange for RGSV ablation therapy
at her next visit. Risks, benefits, and alternatives were discussed in great
detail. We also discussed considering venogram of the RLE given her treatment
refractor edema as she has been compliant with conservative treatment therapy
including compression socks and diuretic therapy without significant symptom
relief. Educational material on venogram and May-Thurner syndrome were provided
to the patient on today's visit. She complains of lower extremity numbness and
cramping as well as pain, we will arrange for BLE arterial doppler on today's
visit. Preliminary images were reviewed and discussed revealing mild
atherosclerotic plaque and significant edema was also a noted finding. All
questions and concerns were answered and addressed. Heart healthy diet and
healthy lifestyle encouraged and endorsed. She is to follow up in 1 week or
sooner should symptoms worsen. She agrees to the plan of care

Transition of Care
This is a 62-year-old female, former smoker, non-ETOH user, referred by Roseanne Hoey who is her cousin with a significant medical history of COPD (oxygen dependent after RSV in December 2024), HLD, history of SVT, currently on diltiazem and metoprolol as well as a history of pulmonary nodules, following with Dr. Park, who presents today for initial CV consultation with complaints of lower extremity edema. She works for the DMV, has no children and lives in Port Jervis. She has a significant family history of melanoma in her sister. She reports lower extremity edema, heaviness, aching and pain as well as shortness of breath. She follows with her PCP, Amanda Hansen, at MMPC and reports recently seeing her primary cardiologist, Dr. Winchester-Penny on 08/19/25. She reports prior to that she had seen her in April 2025 after recent hospitalization. She was hospitalized where she experienced an episode of SVT. She reports prior to this her last episode of SVT was approximately 11 years ago where she was started on metoprolol and did not experience repeat episodes until she was hospitalized. Her metoprolol was subsequently increased to 50 mg daily and she was also started on diltiazem at that time. Her SVT was managed with diltiazem, metoprolol, and Valsalva maneuver while hospitalized. She has a history of pulmonary nodules for which she saw Marion Park but is unhappy with her plan of care at this time. She also reports seeing Hudson Valley CV and saw PA at the practice for lower extremity edema. She underwent imaging and was told that she did not have venous insufficiency but continues to experience lower extremity swelling, heaviness, and aching as well as discoloration to her lower extremities. At that point, a CT venogram was ordered but she wanted to seek a second opinion for which she presents today. She complains of intermittent lightheadedness and dizziness. She denies any active chest pain, chest pressure, syncope or near-syncopal events.
Echocardiogram: Ejection fraction of 55% with trivial PB, mild MR and moderate TR.
Carotid doppler: Moderate atherosclerotic disease.
ABI/PVR: RLE of 1.07 and LLE of 1.24.
BLE venous reflux study: Negative for any evidence of DVT but bilateral significant reflux as well as edema noted.
CTA of the thorax: Severe pulmonary emphysema with multiple solid pulmonary nodules in the left upper lobe measuring up to 5 mm.
For further evaluation of shortness of breath, we will arrange for EKG and echocardiogram today. Preliminary images were reviewed and discussed revealing an ejection fraction of 55% with trivial PB, mild MR and moderate TR. Given complaints of lightheadedness and dizziness, we will arrange for a carotid doppler. Preliminary images were reviewed and discussed revealing moderate atherosclerotic disease. Given finding of decreased pedal pulses on physical examination, we will arrange for an ABI/PVR revealing an RLE of 1.07 and an LLE of 1.24. We will arrange for BLE arterial doppler at her next visit given her decreased pedal pulses found on physical examination and complaints of lower extremity pain and discomfort. We will arrange for BLE venous reflux exam on today's visit given lower extremity heaviness and aching as well as intermittent edema. Preliminary images were reviewed and discussed which were negative for any evidence of DVT but bilateral significant reflux as well as edema noted. She remains compliant with compression stocking therapy during the day, resting and elevating her legs at night but has not experienced significant symptom relief. We provided the patient with educational material on venous insufficiency as well as treatment with venous ablation therapy and possible venogram. We will arrange for routine blood work for assessment of overall health on today's visit which we will review and discuss at her next follow up. She expressed concern of treatment with combined pharmacological therapy with both metoprolol and diltiazem for maximal control of her SVT. She completed a CTA of the thorax on 06/21/25 which we reviewed and discussed today revealing severe pulmonary emphysema with multiple solid pulmonary nodules in the left upper lobe measuring up to 5 mm. We discussed further evaluation at a future follow up and possible biopsy. We will also be referring her to Dr. Bezdicek, pulmonology, for further evaluation. All questions and concerns were answered and addressed. Heart healthy diet and healthy lifestyle encouraged and endorsed. She is to follow up in 2 weeks or sooner should symptoms worsen. She agrees to the plan of care

This is a 62-year-old female, former smoker, non-ETOH user, with a significant medical history of COPD (oxygen dependent after RSV in December 2024), HLD, history of SVT, currently on diltiazem and metoprolol as well as a history of pulmonary nodules, following with Dr. Park, who presents today for CV follow up for lower extremity edema. She continues to complain of lower extremity heaviness, aching and swelling. She completed routine labs at her last visit which she would like to review and discuss today. She was following with her PCP, Amanda Hanson, at MMPC and saw a pulmonologist, Dr. Park. She reports undergoing chest x-ray at MMPC revealing bilateral atelectasis without any evidence of consolidation. She reports dissatisfaction with her plan of care provided by her prior primary care provider and pulmonologist and believes that her concerns are not adequately addressed and is seeking second opinion and more comprehensive evaluation and treatment plan and desires a collaborative approach to her ongoing medical management. She has undergone DEXA bone density scan testing in the past and reports a T-score of 2.4 indicating low bone mass indicating osteopenia. She reports that she is currently pending a chest CT on 12/12/25 with Dr. Park. She denies any active chest pain, chest pressure, syncope or near-syncopal events and continues to use supplemental oxygen therapy given her history of COPD.
Echocardiogram: Ejection fraction of 55% with trivial PB, mild MR and moderate TR.
Carotid doppler: Moderate atherosclerotic disease.
ABI/PVR: RLE of 1.07 and LLE of 1.24.
BLE venous reflux study: Negative for any evidence of DVT but bilateral significant reflux as well as edema noted.
CTA of the thorax: Severe pulmonary emphysema with multiple solid pulmonary nodules in the left upper lobe measuring up to 5 mm.
BLE arterial doppler: Mild atherosclerotic plaque and significant edema.
DEXA bone density test: T-score of 2.4 indicating low bone mass (osteopenia)
On physical examination, the patient has lower extremity edema, worse in her RLE. We will arrange for CDT of BLE on today's visit. Given her dissatisfaction with her current pulmonology care, we will be referring her to Dr. Bezdicek and we discussed further evaluation of her findings on recent chest x-ray and possible biopsy should it be needed. We reviewed and discussed her routine labs completed at her last visit revealing an LDL of 145, a hemoglobin A1c of 5.8, and a normal thyroid panel. We will be initiating treatment for her hyperlipidemia with Crestor 10 mg daily. She continues to complain of lower extremity heaviness, aching and swelling despite compliance with compression stocking therapy during the day, resting and elevating her legs at night without significant symptom relief. We will arrange for RGSV ablation therapy at her next visit. Risks, benefits, and alternatives were discussed in great detail. We also discussed considering venogram of the RLE given her treatment refractor edema as she has been compliant with conservative treatment therapy including compression socks and diuretic therapy without significant symptom relief. Educational material on venogram and May-Thurner syndrome were provided to the patient on today's visit. She complains of lower extremity numbness and cramping as well as pain, we will arrange for BLE arterial doppler on today's visit. Preliminary images were reviewed and discussed revealing mild atherosclerotic plaque and significant edema was also a noted finding. All questions and concerns were answered and addressed. Heart healthy diet and healthy lifestyle encouraged and endorsed. She is to follow up in 1 week or sooner should symptoms worsen. She agrees to the plan of care
