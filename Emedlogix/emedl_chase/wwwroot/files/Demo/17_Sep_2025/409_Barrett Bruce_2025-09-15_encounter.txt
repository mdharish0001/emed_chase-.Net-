For
further ischemic evaluation of his shortness of breath on exertion, we will
arrange for coronary stress testing with Lexiscan on today's visit. Risks,
benefits, and alternatives to the diagnostic study were discussed in great
detail. We will review and discuss the results at his next follow up. Given his
finding of thyroid nodule on carotid doppler, we will arrange for a dedicated
thyroid nodule at a future visit. Thyroid nodule measured 0.8 cm consistent
with TIRADS score of 2/3. We discussed repeating thyroid ultrasound in 6 months
for further surveillance. We will review and discuss the results at his next
visit. All questions and concerns were answered and addressed. Heart healthy
diet and healthy lifestyle encouraged and endorsed. He is to follow up in 1
week or sooner should symptoms worsen. He agrees to the plan of care

Transition of Care
This is a 76-year-old male with significant medical history who presents today for CV follow up for shortness of breath. He continues to complain of shortness of breath on exertion, unchanged from his last visit. He was also found to have thyroid nodules on carotid doppler at a prior visit. We had discussed evaluation with a dedicated thyroid ultrasound. He denies any chest pain, chest pressure, syncope or near-syncopal events.
For further ischemic evaluation of his shortness of breath on exertion, we will arrange for coronary stress testing with Lexiscan on today's visit. Risks, benefits, and alternatives to the diagnostic study were discussed in great detail. We will review and discuss the results at his next follow up. Given his finding of thyroid nodule on carotid doppler, we will arrange for a dedicated thyroid nodule at a future visit. Thyroid nodule measured 0.8 cm consistent with TIRADS score of 2/3. We discussed repeating thyroid ultrasound in 6 months for further surveillance. We will review and discuss the results at his next visit. All questions and concerns were answered and addressed. Heart healthy diet and healthy lifestyle encouraged and endorsed. He is to follow up in 1 week or sooner should symptoms worsen. He agrees to the plan of care.
