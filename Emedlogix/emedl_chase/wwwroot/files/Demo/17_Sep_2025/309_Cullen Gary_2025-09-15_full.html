<p>The patient's chronic pain is likely multifactorial, stemming from his</p>
<p>history of spinal fusion, degenerative changes, and ongoing musculoskeletal</p>
<p>issues. His pain is currently being managed with Percocet every 12 hours as</p>
<p>needed. We discussed the continuation of this regimen while also exploring</p>
<p>additional pain management techniques, including interventional options if</p>
<p>necessary. A referral to pain management has been placed for further evaluation</p>
<p>and optimization of his treatment plan. BMP was checked, and no signs of abuse</p>
<p>were noted. The patient has been educated on the potential side effects of</p>
<p>Percocet, including risks of dependency and long-term opioid use. We also</p>

<p>This is a 60-year-old male, current smoker, with significant medical history of emphysema, migraines, HLD, PAD, chronic pain syndrome and fibromyalgia, who presents today for CV follow-up for evaluation of her symptoms of chest discomfort. He also has a history of chronic pain syndrome and fibromyalgia. He said that he was on Percocet by his primary care physician at Middletown Medical. He wants to change his primary care over with us as well and wants to Percocet to be prescribed for chronic pain syndrome and chronic back pain. He said that two days back he had an episode of chest discomfort and he had to take sublingual nitroglycerin and his pain was alleviated with sublingual nitroglycerin. He denies any shortness of breath, syncope or near syncopal events.</p>
<p>We are going to renew his Percocet 5 mg every eight hours p.r.n. He is also pending a cardiac catheterization in two days for his abnormal stress test. We discussed with his wife, Sharon in the room as well. We are going to arrange for cardiac catheterization in two days, right and left heart cardiac catheterization. Follow-up as scheduled or sooner if any symptoms arise. Heart healthy diet and healthy lifestyle encouraged and endorsed. All questions and concerns were answered and addressed.</p>

For post angiogram evaluation, we will arrange for a left lower extremity arterial doppler. We will also arrange for a CBC and CMP today as well. For his leg ache and associated heaviness with itchiness and restlessness, we will also arrange for a bilateral lower extremity venous reflux study at the next visit for further evaluation of his peripheral vascular system. He will continue with optimal medical management for his non-obstructive CAD. We will see him back in one to two weeks or sooner if symptoms arise. He agrees with the plan of care.</p>

The patient has a history of spinal fusion and has chronic lumbar pain with radiculopathy. Due to his need for dual antiplatelet therapy, it is not recommended that he take chronic NSAIDs. We discussed possibly starting physical therapy for his chronic pain; however, patient states due to his high co-pay he is not able to afford that. His prescription monitoring is consistent with use, his reference number is 219478979. The patient reports he also quit smoking 1 month ago and has not restarted. We discussed and reviewed his recent sleep apnea testing which showed patient is negative for any obstructive sleep apnea, and the study was of good quality.

<p>This is a 61-year-old male, current smoker, with significant medical history of emphysema, migraines, HLD, PAD, chronic pain syndrome, and fibromyalgia, who presents today for a cardiovascular follow-up for review of recent labs and with complaints of fatigue and leg discomfort. He reports fatigue more so in the afternoons. He also reports significant pain in his back. He reports pending pain management evaluation at this time. He also reports leg discomfort. He denies any chest pain, chest pressure, shortness of breath, syncope, or near syncopal events.</p>
<p>R/L Cardiac Cath 05/14/24: Non-obstructive CAD; normal LVEDP; normal PAP; LAD 1st diagonal branch 50% stenosed</p>
<p>Cardiac catheterization 05/20/2024: Non-obstructive CAD.</p>
<p>Peripheral angiogram, 04/26/2024 right pedal access: RSFA 80% stenosis status post balloon angioplasty of RSFA.</p>
<p>Peripheral angiogram 06/12/2024, left anterior tibial artery access: LSFA 70% stenosis, LPA 80% stenosis, LATA 80% stenosis.</p>
<p>Ultrasound: Non-vascular tissue lump which appears to possibly be cellulitis possibly from a potential bite.</p>
<p>Venous reflux images: Significant bilateral GSV reflux</p>
<p>We review and discuss the results of his recent labs. His kidney and liver enzymes returned unremarkable. His hemoglobin A1C is 5.3. His LDL is 87. His complete blood count was unremarkable. His thyroid panel was also very stable. He is pending evaluation with Dr. Weinstein, pain management on 08/01/24. He decided against evaluation with Dr. Wang at this time as he has seen him in the past. He is seeing Dr. Weinstein for an evaluation on his chronic back discomfort. We will see him back in four to six weeks or sooner if symptoms arise. He was encouraged to remain compliant with heart-healthy diet and healthy lifestyle. We will see him back at that time.</p>

<p>This is a 61-year-old male with a significant medical history of emphysema, migraines, HLDP, chronic pain syndrome, and fibromyalgia. His past surgical history includes spinal fusion in 2001 and bilateral hip replacement approximately five to seven years ago. He is a smoker which may contribute to his ongoing musculoskeletal and vascular concerns. He presents for follow-up regarding chronic lower back pain and associated right foot numbness. His pain has persisted despite previous conservative management, and he was referred to a neurosurgeon. However, surgical intervention is deferred at this time due to his current medical history.</p>

<p>Peripheral angiogram 06/12/2024, left anterior tibial artery access: LSFA 70% stenosis, LPA 80% stenosis, LATA 80% stenosis.</p>
<p>Ultrasound: Non-vascular tissue lump which appears to possibly be cellulitis possibly from a potential bite.</p>
<p>Venous reflux images: Significant bilateral GSV reflux</p>
<p>Echocardiogram: No significant valvular abnormality, preserved ejection fraction.</p>
<p>ABI/PVR: RLE 0.50 and LLE 0.28</p>
<p>Arterial doppler: Moderate atherosclerotic plaque in bilateral lower extremity arteries with patent flow.</p>
<p>The patient's chronic pain is likely multifactorial, stemming from his history of spinal fusion, degenerative changes, and ongoing musculoskeletal issues. His pain is currently being managed with Percocet every 12 hours as needed. We discussed the continuation of this regimen while also exploring additional pain management techniques, including interventional options if necessary. A referral to pain management has been placed for further evaluation and optimization of his treatment plan. BMP was checked, and no signs of abuse were noted. The patient has been educated on the potential side effects of Percocet, including risks of dependency and long-term opioid use. We also discussed the possibility of further neurosurgical evaluation should his symptoms progress or fail to respond to conservative management.</p>

<p>This is a 61-year-old male, current smoker, with significant medical history of emphysema, migraines, HLD, PAD, chronic pain syndrome, and fibromyalgia, who presents today for a cardiovascular follow-up with complaints of back discomfort and chest pain. He was recently evaluated by Dr. Weinstein, pain management in Goshen and reports he was sent for further evaluation and treatment with lumbar injections. However, he states these epidural injections would cost him about over $300 in a copay for which he cannot afford, so he does not want to continue to follow with Dr. Weinstein. He also reports they cannot manage his opioid refills as they are mostly interventional only. He also reports intermittent chest discomfort with heaviness in the substernal region of his chest. He reports this comes on at random and is without any exertional influence. He reports this has been ongoing for the last few days. He reports mild chest heaviness during today's visit. Denies any shortness of breath, syncope, or near syncopal events. He also reports leg cramps intermittently as well which have been ongoing and persistent as well.</p>
