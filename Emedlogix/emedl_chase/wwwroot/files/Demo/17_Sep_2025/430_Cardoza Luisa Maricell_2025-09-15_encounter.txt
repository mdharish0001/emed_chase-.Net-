She
continues to complain of lower extremity heaviness, aching and swelling as well
as restless legs. She has undergone venous ablation therapy in the past, which
was negative for any evidence of DVT but positive for BLE reflux. Given her
persistent symptoms of heaviness, aching and swelling as well as itching and
burning at the sites of bulging varicosities and restlessness despite
compliance with compression stocking therapy for over 6 months without
significant symptom relief, we will arrange for RGSV ablation therapy on
today's visit. Risks, benefits, and alternatives were discussed in great
detail. She was encouraged to continue wearing compression socks during the
day, resting and elevating her legs at night. All questions and concerns were
answered and addressed. Heart healthy diet and healthy lifestyle encouraged and
endorsed. She was encouraged to follow up in 1 week for post-venous ablation
evaluation or sooner should symptoms worsen. She agrees to the plan of care
