<p>complication. She understands that long-term side effects of Semaglutide are</p>
<p>not well known. She also understands the importance of an ongoing caloric</p>
<p>deficit for optimal weight reduction, increasing her activity and her</p>
<p>hydration. We discussed the importance of ongoing caloric deficit and dietary</p>
<p>modification. We will see her back in 1 week or sooner if symptoms arise. She</p>
<p>agrees to the plan of care.</p>
<p>The patient was</p>
<p>monitored for over 15 minutes post procedure. The patient was evaluated for any</p>

<p>which revealed an RLE of 0.69 and LLE of 0.19. For her complaints of lower extremity</p>
<p>heaviness, aching, and swelling, we also arranged for a venous reflux exam at</p>
<p>today's visit. Preliminary images were reviewed and discussed, which were</p>
<p>negative for any evidence of DVT but positive for bilateral lower extremity</p>
<p>reflux. Given her persistent lower extremity heaviness, aching, swelling, as</p>
<p>well as itching and burning at the sites of bulging varicosities despite</p>
<p>compliance with compression stocking therapy, rest, and leg elevation at night</p>
<p>without significant symptom relief, we will arrange for RGSV venous ablation</p>
<p>therapy at her next visit. Risks, benefits, and alternatives were discussed in</p>
<p>great detail. All questions and concerns were answered and addressed. A</p>

<p>She is tolerating tirzepatide well. We will continue with her current dose today. Tirzepatide 15 mg was administered SC to the right arm without complication. She understands that the long-term side effects of tirzepatide are not well known. She also understands the importance of ongoing caloric deficit for optimal weight reduction. We discussed increasing her hydration and her activity levels as well. She is eating a lot less but reports not having changed her eating habits. We discussed not just counting on the shots and instead maintaining diet modification, increasing her protein and vegetable intake, and decreasing her intake of processed and carbohydrate-rich foods. Zepbound was previously sent to her pharmacy but was not approved by her insurance. She would like to continue receiving the injections in our office. A heart-healthy diet and healthy lifestyle modifications were encouraged and endorsed. All questions and concerns were answered and addressed to complete understanding and satisfaction. We will see her back in 1 week or sooner, should symptoms arise. She agrees to the plan of care.</p>

<p>She is tolerating Semaglutide well. We will increase her dose today. Semaglutide 0.5 mg administered SC to the left arm without complication today. She understands that long-term side effects of Semaglutide are not well-known. She also understands the importance of ongoing caloric deficit for optimal weight reduction. She was advised to increase her activity and her hydration. All questions and concerns were answered and addressed. Heart healthy diet and healthy lifestyle encouraged and endorsed. We will see her back in 1 week or sooner if symptoms arise. She agrees to the plan of care.</p>

She reports she recently completed peripheral angiogram with left femoral artery access. She reports improvement in her left groin bruising and associated discomfort. She is compliant on her Plavix without any further abnormal bleeding or bruising. She reports overall feeling well. She does report wanting to consider weight management and is interested in participating in our weight loss clinic here at Epic. She reports a longstanding history of inability to lose weight. She also reports following multiple diets in the past without significant weight loss. She does report that her fatigue and intermittent shortness of breath is simply contributed from her obesity and her feelings of being out of breath. She does report walking easier since recent peripheral intervention. She denies any chest pain, chest pressure, shortness of breath at rest, syncope or near-syncopal events.</p>

<p>This is a 70-year-old female, former smoker, with a medical history of HTN, HLD, venous insufficiency, and obesity, who presents today for initial consult with heaviness, achiness, numbness, and tingling of bilateral lower extremities and discoloration of her bilateral feet. She has significant reticular varicose veins to her bilateral lower extremities causing significant heaviness and achiness since the past few weeks. Since the past few months she has been compliant on compression stockings with minimal symptomatic relief.  Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, SOB, blurred or double vision, syncope or near syncopal events. Denies any family history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden cardiac death.</p>
<p>Today I am going to arrange for an ABI/PVR as she has more than 60 pack/year smoking history. If her ABIs are normal we will arrange for arterial doppler at the next visit. For her reticular, varicose, and spider veins I am going to arrange for a BLE venous reflux study. For her dizziness I am going to arrange for a carotid doppler as well.</p>

<p>She is tolerating tirzepatide well. We will continue with her current dose today. Tirzepatide 15 mg was administered SC to the right arm without complication. She understands that the long-term side effects of tirzepatide are not well known. She also understands the importance of ongoing caloric deficit for optimal weight reduction. We discussed increasing her hydration and her activity levels as well. She is eating a lot less but reports not having changed her eating habits. We discussed not just counting on the shots and instead maintaining diet modification, increasing her protein and vegetable intake, and decreasing her intake of processed and carbohydrate-rich foods. Zepbound was previously sent to her pharmacy but was not approved by her insurance. She would like to continue receiving the injections in our office. A heart-healthy diet and healthy lifestyle modifications were encouraged and endorsed. All questions and concerns were answered and addressed to complete understanding and satisfaction. We will see her back in 1 week or sooner, should symptoms arise. She agrees to the plan of care.</p>

<p>We will consider increasing her HCTZ if her BP remains elevated at the next visit. Given her strong family history of coronary artery disease and exertional SOB we will arrange for further ischemic evaluation with coronary stress testing. She is pending CT of the thyroid without contrast for further evaluation of thyroid nodules found on carotid doppler. She was advised to maintain a healthy lifestyle and increase her activity and hydration. All questions and concerns were answered and addressed. She agrees with the plan of care. Follow up in 1-2 weeks or sooner if symptoms arise or worsen.</p>

<p>Transition of Care</p>
<p>This is a 70-year-old female, former smoker, with significant medical history as noted as he says, who presents today for CV followup for recent testing and with complaints of leg discomfort. She complains of bilateral lower extremity ache, heaviness, and fatigue in her legs along with associated numbness. She does report underlying discoloration to her lower extremities as well. She denies any wounds or ulcers to her legs or feet. She does remain compliant with compression stockings, however, reports insignificant symptom improvement. She denies any chest pain, chest pressure, syncope or near syncopal events. She has a strong family history of premature coronary artery disease as her mother had bypass and had CABG in an early age. She complains of exertional shortness of breath, however she denies any shortness of breath at rest.</p>
<p>Carotid doppler: 50-69% bilateral ICA stenosis. Mild plaque seen in bilateral carotid plaque. Incidentally found thyroid nodule. Thyroid ultrasound with right and left lobe solid nodules, both of which are hypoechoic.</p>
<p>BLE venous reflux study. No evidence of DVT, significant bilateral GSV reflux</p>
<p>We reviewed and discussed the results of her recent carotid doppler and thyroid ultrasound. For her thyroid nodules found, we will arrange for CT of the thyroid without contrast for further evaluation. We also reviewed and discussed the results of her recent venous reflux study, which revealed significant venous insufficiency. Educational material and venous insufficiency was discussed and provided. We also discussed in great detail treatment therapy for venous insufficiency such as ablation and sclerotherapy. She was encouraged to maintain compliance with compression stockings during the day, rest and elevate her legs at night. For her ongoing leg discomfort with noted achiness more so when she walks, we will also arrange for a bilateral lower extremity arterial doppler. For her significant family history of coronary artery disease and also shortness of breath with exertion, we will arrange for an echocardiogram today and also a Lexiscan for further cardiovascular risk stratification. All questions and concerns were answered and addressed. She agrees with the plan of care.</p>
