The patient's chronic pain is likely multifactorial, stemming from his\par
history of spinal fusion, degenerative changes, and ongoing musculoskeletal\par
issues. His pain is currently being managed with Percocet every 12 hours as\par
needed. We discussed the continuation of this regimen while also exploring\par
additional pain management techniques, including interventional options if\par
necessary. A referral to pain management has been placed for further evaluation\par
and optimization of his treatment plan. BMP was checked, and no signs of abuse\par
were noted. The patient has been educated on the potential side effects of\par
Percocet, including risks of dependency and long-term opioid use. We also\par
discussed the possibility of further neurosurgical evaluation should his\par
symptoms progress or fail to respond to conservative management.\par
Patient was informed of the telemedicine visit by our office staff. Telemedicine was described in detail to the patient as the use of synchronous video and audio communication to provide clinical care from a distance. A telemedicine visit can provide the same medical standard of care for specific conditions. The patient was informed that the practice staff located at the provider's office would assist in carrying out any recommendations and clinical care.\par

We will start him at 300 mg 3 times a day. The patient has a history of spinal\par
fusion and has chronic lumbar pain with radiculopathy. Due to his need for dual\par
antiplatelet therapy, it is not recommended that he take chronic NSAIDs. We discussed\par
possibly starting physical therapy for his chronic pain; however, patient\par
states due to his high co-pay he is not able to afford that. His prescription\par
monitoring is consistent with use, his reference number is 219478979. The patient\par
reports he also quit smoking 1 month ago and has not restarted. We discussed\par
and reviewed his recent sleep apnea testing which showed patient is negative\par
for any obstructive sleep apnea, and the study was of good quality. All\par
questions and concerns answered and addressed. A heart-healthy diet and\par

Risk of cardiac catheterization explained to the patient in detail.All questions were answered and explained in laymen terms with coronary anatomy delineatedon a graphic. Cardiac catheterization procedure was also explained in a stepwise fashion. Afterpatient expressed full satisfaction, an informed consent was obtained.Patient expressed adherence to prolonged DAPT therapy in the event of a PCI. Denies anyanticipated upcoming surgery or significant active bleeding problems.Patient was made aware of the following potential complications:*The risk of a major complication (death, myocardial infarction, or major embolization) duringor after diagnostic cardiac catheterization is well below 1 percent.*Mortality is under 0.1 percent. Risk factors for death include advancing age, higher New YorkHeart Association heart failure class, left main coronary artery disease, severe left ventriculardysfunction, as well as the presence of valvular heart disease, diabetes mellitus requiring insulintherapy, peripheral artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, and pulmonary insufficiency.*The risk of myocardial infarction is under 0.1 percent. Risk factors include the extent ofdisease, the presence of insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, and recent non-ST elevationmyocardial infarction.*The risk of stroke has been reported to be as high as 0.2 to 0.4 percent. Risk factors for strokeinclude the severity of coronary artery disease, the length of fluoroscopy time, diabetes,hypertension, prior stroke, or renal failure.*Local complications at the site of catheter insertion are among the most common problems seenafter cardiac catheterization. These problems may include acute thrombosis, distal embolization,dissection, poorly controlled bleeding, hematoma, retroperitoneal hemorrhage, pseudoaneurysm,or arteriovenous fistula.*Other potentially serious complications include: ventricular tachyarrhythmias, severebradycardia, allergic reactions, atheroembolism, and acute kidney injury (contrast nephropathy).Mortality 0.11%Myocardial infarction 0.05%Cerebrovascular accident 0.07%Arrhythmia 0.38%Vascular complications 0.43%Contrast reaction 0.37%Hemodynamic complications 0.26%Perforation of heart chamber 0.28%Other complications 0.28%Total of all major complications 1.70%In the event of a PCI, periprocedural complications of percutaneous coronary intervention wereexplained to the patient.*Coronary artery complications such as perforation, distal embolization, side branch occlusion,or stent thrombosis.*Myocardial ischemia and infarction. Occasionally, this may require urgent coronary arterybypass graft surgery.

We will be switching his Plavix, which will be taking it every other day due to his new-onset of easy bruising. Side effects were discussed in great detail. We encouraged him to continue monitoring for easy bruising. We also encouraged him to continue his ranolazine. He reports that he obtained labs from Middletown Medical, which we will obtain a copy of. For his lower extremity numbness and tingling, we will arrange for an ABI/PVR, revealing an RLE of 0.58 and LLE of 1.12. All questions and concerns were answered and addressed. A heart-healthy diet and healthy lifestyle was encouraged and endorsed. He is to follow up in one month or sooner should symptoms worsen, progress, or new symptoms arise. He agrees with the plan of care.\par

This is a 60-year-old male, current smoker, with significant medical history of emphysema, migraines, HLD, PAD, chronic pain syndrome and fibromyalgia, who presents today for CV follow-up for evaluation of her symptoms of chest discomfort. He also has a history of chronic pain syndrome and fibromyalgia. He said that he was on Percocet by his primary care physician at Middletown Medical. He wants to change his primary care over with us as well and wants to Percocet to be prescribed for chronic pain syndrome and chronic back pain. He said that two days back he had an episode of chest discomfort and he had to take sublingual nitroglycerin and his pain was alleviated with sublingual nitroglycerin. He denies any shortness of breath, syncope or near syncopal events.\par
We are going to renew his Percocet 5 mg every eight hours p.r.n. He is also pending a cardiac catheterization in two days for his abnormal stress test. We discussed with his wife, Sharon in the room as well. We are going to arrange for cardiac catheterization in two days, right and left heart cardiac catheterization. Follow-up as scheduled or sooner if any symptoms arise. Heart healthy diet and healthy lifestyle encouraged and endorsed. All questions and concerns were answered and addressed.\par

This is a 61-year-old male, current smoker, with significant medical history of emphysema, migraines, HLD, PAD, chronic pain syndrome, and fibromyalgia, who presents today for a cardiovascular follow-up with complaints of leg discomfort and left leg irritation. He reports waking up with a very tender, warm lump to his left calf. He states that it has been there and he feels it is worsening. He reports it is worsening in regard to surrounding redness and very tender to touch. He denies any injury or trauma to the leg. He also reports ongoing ache, heaviness, and fatigue to his legs as well along with itching to his legs. He denies any chest pain, chest pressure, shortness of breath, syncope, or near-syncopal events.\par

Peripheral angiogram 06/12/2024, left anterior tibial artery access: LSFA 70% stenosis, LPA 80% stenosis, LATA 80% stenosis.\par
Ultrasound: Non-vascular tissue lump which appears to possibly be cellulitis possibly from a potential bite.\par
Venous reflux images: Significant bilateral GSV reflux\par
For his leg ache, heaviness, and fatigue, plan will be to arrange for BLE venous reflux study today. We will also arrange for a soft tissue ultrasound on what appears to be a hardened, tender lump to his left calf. Preliminary images of LLE soft tissue ultrasound reveal a non-vascular tissue lump which appears to possibly be cellulitis possibly from a potential bite. We will start him on doxycycline. He was advised to avoid direct sunlight. Preliminary venous reflux images reviewed and discussed revealing significant bilateral GSV reflux noted. He was encouraged use compression stockings during the day, rest and elevate his legs at night. For his intermittent fatigue, we will arrange for cardiac rehab for him as well. All questions and concerns were answered and addressed. Heart healthy diet and healthy lifestyle encouraged and endorsed. He reports having a pain management consultation with Dr. Weinstein on 07/03/24, which he was encouraged to keep his appointment. We will see him back in 1 to 2 weeks or sooner if symptoms arise. He agrees to the plan of care.\par

This is a 60-year-old male, current smoker, with significant medical history of emphysema, migraines, HLD, PAD, who presents today for CV follow-up to discuss his cardiac catheterization. He states that he still has on and off symptoms of chest discomfort. He had a stress test done recently which showed possible anterior wall ischemia. He reports discomfort comes on at random, but is also noted with exertion. He reports improvement in his chest discomfort with rest. He does also leg discomfort with associated cramping in his legs more noticeable with ambulation. He is unable to walk farther than 20 to 30 feet without requiring frequent rest periods. He also ambulates with the assistance of a cane at times as well. He denies any active chest pain, chest pressure, shortness of breath at rest, syncope or near syncopal events. He denies any wounds or ulcers to his legs or feet.\par

This is a 60-year-old male, current smoker, with significant medical history of emphysema, migraines, HLD, PAD, who presents today for CV follow-up for evaluation for his chest pain. He said that he has on and off symptoms of chest discomfort. Today, while in clinic, he complains of left-sided chest discomfort, 5/10 intensity, non-radiating, worsened with exertion. Denies palpitations, dizziness, SOB, blurred or double vision, syncope or near syncopal events. Denies any family history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden cardiac death.\par
He had an abnormal stress test. We advised him to go to the emergency room. However, the patient does not want to go to the emergency room. We did an EKG in the office today, which shows sinus bradycardia, non-specific ST-T changes. We ordered a coronary CTA which is supposed to be done. He has been advised cardiac catheterization but it has been denied by his insurance. We are going to recommend sublingual nitroglycerin PRN for pain. Also starting him on Imdur 60 mg daily. He will follow up with me in 1-2 weeks' time. We did blood work including CBC and troponin on him.\par
Total time spent 80 minutes, more than 50% of the time spent face to face discussing etiology, pathophysiology, reviewing images with the patient.\par

The patient's chronic pain is likely multifactorial, stemming from his history of spinal fusion, degenerative changes, and ongoing musculoskeletal issues. His pain is currently being managed with Percocet every 12 hours as needed. We discussed the continuation of this regimen while also exploring additional pain management techniques, including interventional options if necessary. A referral to pain management has been placed for further evaluation and optimization of his treatment plan. BMP was checked, and no signs of abuse were noted. The patient has been educated on the potential side effects of Percocet, including risks of dependency and long-term opioid use. We also discussed the possibility of further neurosurgical evaluation should his symptoms progress or fail to respond to conservative management.\par
