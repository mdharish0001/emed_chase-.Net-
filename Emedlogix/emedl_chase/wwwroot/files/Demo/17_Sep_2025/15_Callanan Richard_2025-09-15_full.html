<p>We will arrange for routine blood work</p>
<p>to be completed on today's visit for assessment of overall health as well as</p>
<p>apolipoprotein B and lipoprotein A for assessment of genetic predisposition to</p>
<p>hyperlipidemia. We will arrange for H. pylori testing on today's visit given</p>
<p>his complaints of epigastric chest burning and discomfort which he described as</p>
<p>heartburn. We will arrange for an EKG at his next visit for evaluation of his</p>
<p>chest pain. For further evaluation of his chest pain and discomfort, we will</p>
<p>arrange for echocardiogram on today's visit. Preliminary images were reviewed</p>
<p>and discussed revealing a preserved ejection fraction of 55% to 60% with mild</p>
<p>TR noted. We will arrange for further ischemic evaluation of his chest pain</p>
<p>with ETT and coronary stress testing with Lexiscan at a future visit. On</p>
<p>today's visit, we will arrange for carotid doppler given his given recent TIA.</p>
<p>Preliminary images were reviewed and discussed revealing mild atherosclerotic</p>
<p>disease. He complains of leg pain and discomfort. We will arrange for an</p>
<p>ABI/PVR at his next visit as well as BLE arterial doppler. Given his lower</p>
<p>extremity heaviness and swelling towards his feet, we will arrange for venous</p>
<p>reflux exam on today's visit. Preliminary images were reviewed and discussed</p>
<p>which were negative for any DVT but positive for BLE reflux. We will arrange</p>
<p>for an event monitor to be placed given recent TIA and complaints of chest</p>
<p>pain. We will obtain hospital records from Barnabas Community Hospital in Toms</p>
<p>River given his recent hospitalization. All questions and concerns were</p>
<p>answered and addressed. Heart healthy diet and healthy lifestyle encouraged and</p>
<p>endorsed. He is to follow up on Monday or sooner should symptoms worsen. He</p>
<p>agrees to the plan of care.</p>

<p>Upon physical examination, his blood pressure today was found to be 142/86. At this time, we will initiate labetalol 100 mg BID for management of his elevated blood pressure with associated heart rate of 88 BPM. Side effects were discussed in great detail. During today's visit, we also reviewed and discussed results of his MCT monitor, which was significant for sinus rhythm 100% of the time. For evaluation of his bilateral lower extremity numbness and tingling, we arranged for an ABI/PVR at today's visit. For further evaluation of his headaches, which have been significant since Thursday, we will arrange for blood work to include CBC and CMP. Blood was drawn without complications. We will review and discuss results at his next visit. For further evaluation of his headaches, as well as history of recent TIA 2 weeks ago, we will arrange for an MRI of his brain without contrast. Risks, benefits, and alternatives were discussed in great detail. For management of his hyperlipidemia, the patient was encouraged to remain compliant with Crestor 20 mg, which he has been tolerating well thus far. For further evaluation of his chest pain, we will arrange for ischemic evaluation with coronary stress testing with Lexiscan on 09/15. Risks, benefits, and alternatives were discussed in great detail. All questions and concerns were answered and addressed. A heart-healthy diet and healthy lifestyle were encouraged and endorsed. He will follow up in 1 week or sooner if symptoms arise. He agrees to the plan of care.</p>

<p>This is a 43-year-old male, non-smoker, with a significant medical history of depression and mood disorder for which he follows with his psychiatrist, Dr. Al-Tariq, who presents today for CV follow-up for review of blood work results as well as complaints of headaches. The patient reports significant headaches that began last week on Thursday. He reports that his headaches are primarily right-sided and last all day. His headaches are reportedly throbbing in nature, and he has trialed over-the-counter tension headache medicine with temporary relief of his symptoms. He denies any vision changes associated with his headaches. He does report intermittent episodes of dizziness associated with his headaches. At his previous visit, we arranged for routine labs for assessment of his overall health, which we will review and discuss at today's visit. We also previously initiated Crestor 20 mg for management of his hyperlipidemia, which he reports tolerating well without any ill side effects. We also previously arranged for an MCT monitor to be placed due to history of palpitations as well as recent TIA. We will review and discuss results at today's visit. The patient also reports intermittent lower extremity numbness and tingling. The patient previously reported chest pain that was associated with his TIA about 2 weeks ago. He complains of ongoing dull chest pain and discomfort post-hospitalization. He denies any syncope or near syncopal events.</p>
<p>Echocardiogram: Preserved ejection fraction of 55% to 60% with mild TR noted.</p>
<p>Carotid doppler: Mild atherosclerotic disease.</p>
<p>BLE venous reflux study: Negative for any DVT but positive for BLE reflux.</p>
<p>MCT monitor: sinus rhythm 100% of the time.</p>
<p>Upon physical examination, his blood pressure today was found to be 142/86. At this time, we will initiate labetalol 100 mg BID for management of his elevated blood pressure with associated heart rate of 90 bpm. Side effects were discussed in great detail. During today's visit, we also reviewed and discussed results of his MCT monitor, which was significant for sinus rhythm 100% of the time. We will arrange for an EKG at his next visit for further evaluation of his cardiovascular health. For evaluation of his bilateral lower extremity numbness and tingling, we arranged for an ABI/PVR at today's visit which revealed RLE 1.36 and LLE 1.25. For further evaluation of his headaches, which have been significant since Thursday, we will arrange for blood work to include CBC and CMP. Blood was drawn without complications. We will review and discuss results at his next visit. For further evaluation of his headaches, as well as history of recent TIA 2 weeks ago, we will arrange for an MRI of his brain without contrast. Risks, benefits, and alternatives were discussed in great detail. For management of his hyperlipidemia, the patient was encouraged to remain compliant with Crestor 20 mg, which he has been tolerating well thus far. For further evaluation of his chest pain, we will arrange for ischemic evaluation with coronary stress testing with Lexiscan on 09/15. Risks, benefits, and alternatives were discussed in great detail. All questions and concerns were answered and addressed. A heart-healthy diet and healthy lifestyle were encouraged and endorsed. He will follow up in 1 week or sooner if symptoms arise. He agrees to the plan of care.</p>

<p>Transition of Care</p>
<p>This is a 43-year-old male, non-smoker, referred by Lucy Fratto with a significant medical history of depression and mood disorder for which he follows with his psychiatrist, Dr. Al-Tariq, who presents today for initial CV consultation after a recent hospitalization for TIA. He is a heavy equipment operator for union. He has 2 healthy children and lives in Mount Hope. His PCP is Dr. Hirsch who he has yet to establish care with. He follows with psychiatry, Dr. Al-Tariq. He has a family history of his dad passing in his 60s but he is unsure of the cause and his mother is alive and healthy. He has a past surgical history of surgical intervention of his knee 9 years ago and rhinoplasty after fracture. His only medications include aspirin, Lamictal and Prozac at this time. He was hospitalized approximately 1 week ago after having an episode while in Seaside, New Jersey were he had an episode of epigastric chest pain which he initially believed was heartburn. He reports that it worsened and developed into severe chest pain and had difficulty breathing. He reports that his face and his arm went numb. He called 911 and was transported to Barnabas Community Hospital in Toms River where he was subsequently hospitalized for TIA. He was hospitalized for 3 days and was discharged in stable condition and advised to follow with a primary cardiologist. He received a TNK shot while hospitalized and complains of burning his shoulders across his ribs and in his groin area. He reports that while hospitalized he underwent evaluation with several CT scans and MRIs, all of which were within normal limits. He complains of ongoing dull chest pain and discomfort post hospitalization. He also complains of lower extremity heaviness and aching, more towards his feet. He denies any syncope or near-syncopal events.</p>
<p>Echocardiogram: Preserved ejection fraction of 55% to 60% with mild TR noted.</p>
<p>Carotid doppler: Mild atherosclerotic disease.</p>
<p>BLE venous reflux study: Negative for any DVT but positive for BLE reflux.</p>
<p>We will arrange for routine blood work to be completed on today's visit for assessment of overall health as well as apolipoprotein B and lipoprotein A for assessment of genetic predisposition to hyperlipidemia.
