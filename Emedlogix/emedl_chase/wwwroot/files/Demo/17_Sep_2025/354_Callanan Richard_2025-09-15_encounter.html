<p>Transition of Care</p>
<p>This is a 43-year-old male, non-smoker, with a significant medical history of depression and mood disorder for which he follows with his psychiatrist, Dr. Al-Tariq, who presents today for CV follow up for headaches. He continues to complain of significant headaches that began approximately 2 weeks ago. His headaches are primarily right-sided and last all day. They are throbbing in nature. He has trialed over-the-counter tension headache medication with temporary relief. He denies any vision abnormalities. He does report intermittent episodes of dizziness associated with these episodic headaches. He has a history of recent TIA. A script was provided to the patient at his last visit to undergo an MRI of the brain without contrast for further evaluation of his headaches as well as recent TIA. Authorization was previously pending but was recently approved. He complains of ongoing dull chest pain and discomfort post-hospitalization. He denies any syncope or near-syncopal events.</p>
<p>Echocardiogram: Preserved ejection fraction of 55% to 60% with mild TR noted.</p>
<p>Carotid doppler: Mild atherosclerotic disease.</p>
<p>BLE venous reflux study: Negative for any DVT but positive for BLE reflux.</p>
<p>MCT monitor: sinus rhythm 100% of the time.</p>
<p>As he complains of ongoing dull chest pain and discomfort, we will arrange further ischemic evaluation with coronary stress testing with Lexiscan on today's visit. Risks, benefits, and alternatives to the diagnostic study were discussed in great detail. He was encouraged to complete his MRI of the brain without contrast for further evaluation of his headaches and history of recent TIA. All questions and concerns were answered and addressed. Heart healthy diet and healthy lifestyle encouraged and endorsed. He is to follow up in 1 week to review and discuss his Lexiscan results or sooner should symptoms worsen. He agrees to the plan of care.</p>
