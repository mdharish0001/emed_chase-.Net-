<p>Transition of Care</p>
<p>This is a 39-year-old male with past medical history of type 2 diabetes, anxiety, depression, hyperlipidemia, and obesity, who presents today for a cardiovascular follow up for shortness of breath. He continues to complain of shortness of breath on exertion, unchanged from his last visit. He denies any shortness of breath at rest. He has a history of type 2 diabetes and obesity which is managed with Mounjaro 7.5 mg SC weekly. He is tolerating well. His hemoglobin A1c at his last visit was found to be 6.6. He denies any active chest pain, chest pressure, syncope or near-syncopal events.</p>
<p>Venous reflux study: No evidence of DVT with significant reflux bilaterally.</p>
<p>Echocardiogram: Ejection fraction of 55 to 60% and mild TR.</p>
<p>Carotid doppler: Mild atherosclerotic plaque.</p>
<p>ABI/PVR: RLE 1.31, LLE 1.30.</p>
<p>We will obtain authorization for further ischemic evaluation of his shortness of breath with an ETT at his next visit. On physical examination, his blood pressure was found to be elevated at 140/90 on today's visit. He was advised to avoid sodium rich foods in hopes of better blood pressure control. Should his blood pressure remain elevated at his next visit, we will consider initiating antihypertensive therapy. His hemoglobin A1c at his last visit was found to be 6.6. We discussed for better glycemic control, we will be increasing his Mounjaro to 10 mg SC weekly. Side effects were discussed in great detail. All questions and concerns were answered and addressed. Heart healthy diet and healthy lifestyle encouraged and endorsed. He is to follow up in 1 to 2 weeks for a repeat blood pressure check or sooner should symptoms worsen. He agrees to the plan of care.</p>
