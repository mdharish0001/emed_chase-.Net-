<p>We are going to discuss the results of his recent lab work, which revealed an LDL of 67, creatinine of 0.85, normal LFTs, lipoprotein A of 212, A1C of 6.6, apolipoprotein B of 72, and vitamin D of 19. We discussed his genetic predisposition to hyperlipidemia given his elevated lipoprotein A. We advised him to decrease his intake of fried fatty foods and to make appropriate diet modifications and healthy diet choices. We advised him to remain compliant with his current diabetic regimen and to decrease his intake of processed sugars and foods high in carbohydrates. For further evaluation of possible cardiac morphological abnormality causing his exertional shortness of breath, an echocardiogram was completed today. Preliminary images were reviewed and discussed which revealed an ejection fraction of 55 to 60% and mild TR. A carotid doppler was completed today for evaluation of possible carotid stenosis causing his dizziness and lightheadedness. Preliminary images were reviewed and discussed which revealed mild atherosclerotic plaque. We advised him to avoid any quick position changes and to increase his hydration for prevention of further dizzy episodes. Upon physical examination, he was found to have cold feet for which we arranged for an ABI/PVR, revealing an RLE of 1.31 and an LLE of 1.30. All questions and concerns were answered and addressed. A heart-healthy diet and healthy lifestyle was encouraged and endorsed. He is to follow up in two weeks or sooner should symptoms worsen or new symptoms arise. He agrees with the plan of care.</p>

<p>On today's visit, we arranged for routine lab work as well as lipoprotein</p>
<p>A and apolipoprotein B for further evaluation of his overall health. An EKG was</p>
<p>completed today for evaluation of overall cardiac rhythm. For evaluation of</p>
<p>lower extremity heaviness and restlessness, a venous reflux study was completed</p>
<p>today; preliminary images reviewed and discussed that revealed no evidence of</p>
<p>DVT with significant reflux bilaterally. We advised him to wear compression</p>
<p>socks during the day and to rest and elevate his legs at night. We also</p>
<p>provided him with educational material on venous insufficiency. We will seek</p>
<p>authorization for an echocardiogram for evaluation of cardiac morphology in the</p>
<p>setting of exertional shortness of breath. We will also seek authorization for</p>
<p>a carotid doppler for evaluation of possible carotid stenosis causing his</p>
<p>episodes of dizziness and lightheadedness. Upon physical examination, he was</p>
<p>found to have decreased pedal pulses. For this finding, given the feeling of</p>
<p>numbness and tingling in his bilateral lower extremities, we will seek</p>
<p>authorization for an ABI/PVR. All questions and concerns were answered and addressed.</p>
<p>Heart healthy diet and healthy lifestyle</p>

<p>This is a 39-year-old male, referred by Zocdoc, with past medical history of type 2 diabetes, anxiety, depression, hyperlipidemia, and obesity, who presents today for initial cardiovascular consultation for evaluation of overall cardiovascular health. He currently works at Chrysler in shipping and logistics, has 4 children, and lives in Poughkeepsie. He reports recently relocating from Lencet, Michigan. He has no PCP, with his last primary care appointment being 2 months ago with Dr. Tolman in Michigan. For anxiety and depression management, he was previously on Lexapro and engaged in psychotherapy, but discontinued both due to depression relief. He has a past surgical history of a benign neck lipoma removal and a vasectomy. He is currently on Mounjaro 7.5 mg, rosuvastatin 10 mg, and metformin 1 g, all of which he is tolerating well without any ill side effects. He is up to date with ophthalmology as he wears contact lenses daily. He does report exertional shortness of breath. He also reports some dizziness and lightheadedness. He states feeling numbness, tingling, heaviness, and restlessness in his bilateral lower extremities. He denies any active chest pain, chest pressure, syncope, or near-syncopal events.</p>
<p>Venous reflux study: No evidence of DVT with significant reflux bilaterally.</p>
<p>On today's visit, we arranged for routine lab work as well as lipoprotein A and apolipoprotein B for further evaluation of his overall health. An EKG was completed today for evaluation of overall cardiac rhythm. For evaluation of lower extremity heaviness and restlessness, a venous reflux study was completed today; preliminary images reviewed and discussed that revealed no evidence of DVT with significant reflux bilaterally. We advised him to wear compression socks during the day and to rest and elevate his legs at night. We also provided him with educational material on venous insufficiency. We will seek authorization for an echocardiogram for evaluation of cardiac morphology in the setting of exertional shortness of breath. We will also seek authorization for a carotid doppler for evaluation of possible carotid stenosis causing his episodes of dizziness and lightheadedness. Upon physical examination, he was found to have decreased pedal pulses. For this finding, given the feeling of numbness and tingling in his bilateral lower extremities, we will seek authorization for an ABI/PVR. All questions and concerns were answered and addressed. Heart healthy diet and healthy lifestyle modifications were encouraged and endorsed. He is to follow-up in 1 week or sooner should symptoms worsen or new symptoms arise. He agrees to the plan of care.</p>

<p>This is a 39-year-old male with past medical history of type 2 diabetes, anxiety, depression, hyperlipidemia, and obesity, who presents today for a cardiovascular follow up for shortness of breath. He continues to complain of shortness of breath on exertion, unchanged from his last visit. He denies any shortness of breath at rest. He has a history of type 2 diabetes and obesity which is managed with Mounjaro 7.5 mg SC weekly. He is tolerating well. His hemoglobin A1c at his last visit was found to be 6.6. He denies any active chest pain, chest pressure, syncope or near-syncopal events.</p>
<p>Venous reflux study: No evidence of DVT with significant reflux bilaterally.</p>
<p>Echocardiogram: Ejection fraction of 55 to 60% and mild TR.</p>
<p>Carotid doppler: Mild atherosclerotic plaque.</p>
<p>ABI/PVR: RLE 1.31, LLE 1.30.</p>
<p>We will obtain authorization for further ischemic evaluation of his shortness of breath with an ETT at his next visit. On physical examination, his blood pressure was found to be elevated at 140/90 on today's visit. He was advised to avoid sodium rich foods in hopes of better blood pressure control. Should his blood pressure remain elevated at his next visit, we will consider initiating antihypertensive therapy. His hemoglobin A1c at his last visit was found to be 6.6. We discussed for better glycemic control, we will be increasing his Mounjaro to 10 mg SC weekly. Side effects were discussed in great detail. All questions and concerns were answered and addressed.
