Given complaints in the second
paragraph, and given complaints of shortness of breath on exertion, we will
arrange for EKG and echocardiogram on today's visit. Preliminary images were
reviewed and discussed, revealing an ejection fraction of 55 to 60% with mild
PI, mild TR, and mild MR noted. We will arrange for a carotid doppler, given
complaints of lightheadedness and dizziness. Preliminary images were reviewed
and discussed, revealing mild atherosclerotic disease. We will arrange for an
ABI/PVR, given decreased pedal pulses found on physical examination, revealing
an RLE of 1.11 and an LLE of 1.07. We will arrange for a venous reflux exam,
given lower extremity heaviness and aching, as well as intermittent itching and
burning at the site of bulging varicosities. Preliminary images were reviewed
and discussed, which were negative for any evidence of DVT but positive for
bilateral lower extremity reflux. We provided the patient with educational
material on venous insufficiency and treatment with venous ablation therapy.
She has remained compliant with compression stocking therapy during the day,
and rests and elevates her legs at night. We will obtain authorization for
venous ablation therapy, given her persistent symptoms despite conservative treatment
therapy. All questions and concerns were answered and addressed. A
heart-healthy diet and healthy lifestyle were encouraged and endorsed. She will
follow up in 1 week or sooner if symptoms arise. She agrees to the plan of
care.
Time Spent: Total time spent 110 minutes in face-to-face conversation, examination, reviewing records, discussing treatment options and procedures, pathophysiology, and anatomy. Diet and lifestyle modifications were discussed in great detail.  Images were personally reviewed by me in front of the patient and/or family member and explained on our graphic diagram.  Treatment options, risks, benefits and alternative treatments discussed with the patient in detail. All questions and concerns answered.

For
further ischemic evaluation of her shortness of breath on exertion, we will
arrange for coronary stress testing with Lexiscan. Risks, benefits, and
alternatives were discussed in great detail. We will review and discuss the
results at her next follow up. She complains of lower extremity heaviness and
aching as well as bulging varicosities. She had a venous reflux exam at her
last visit, which we will re-review and discuss today which was negative for any
evidence of DVT but positive for BLE reflux. Given her persistent symptoms of
heaviness, aching and swelling as well as itching and burning at the sites of
bulging varicosities despite compliance with compression stocking therapy for
over 6 months without significant symptom relief, we will arrange for venous
ablation therapy at her next visit. Risks, benefits, and alternatives were
discussed in great detail. All questions and concerns were answered and
addressed. Heart healthy diet and healthy lifestyle encouraged and endorsed.
She is to follow up in 1 week or sooner should symptoms worsen. She agrees to
the plan of care

She
continues to complain of lower extremity heaviness, aching and swelling as well
as restless legs. She has undergone venous ablation therapy in the past, which
was negative for any evidence of DVT but positive for BLE reflux. Given her
persistent symptoms of heaviness, aching and swelling as well as itching and
burning at the sites of bulging varicosities and restlessness despite
compliance with compression stocking therapy for over 6 months without
significant symptom relief, we will arrange for RGSV ablation therapy on
today's visit. Risks, benefits, and alternatives were discussed in great
detail. She was encouraged to continue wearing compression socks during the
day, resting and elevating her legs at night. All questions and concerns were
answered and addressed. Heart healthy diet and healthy lifestyle encouraged and
endorsed. She was encouraged to follow up in 1 week for post-venous ablation
evaluation or sooner should symptoms worsen. She agrees to the plan of care

She is a non-smoker with a past surgical history of C-section. She denies any family history of heart disease and denies any past medical history herself. She currently does not take any medications. She presents today for initial cardiovascular consultation with complaints of lower extremity pain. She complains of lower extremity heaviness and aching as well as bulging varicosities and reticular veins that cause significant discomfort as they itch and burn at the site of them. She also complains of restless legs. She complains of shortness of breath on exertion as well as intermittent lightheadedness and dizziness. She denies any active chest pain, chest pressure, syncope, or near syncopal events.
