<p>physical examination, the patient has lower extremity edema, worse in her RLE.</p>
<p>We will arrange for CDT of BLE on today's visit. Given her dissatisfaction with</p>
<p>her current pulmonology care, we will be referring her to Dr. Bezdicek and we</p>
<p>discussed further evaluation of her findings on recent chest x-ray and possible</p>
<p>biopsy should it be needed. We reviewed and discussed her routine labs</p>
<p>completed at her last visit revealing an LDL of 145, a hemoglobin A1c of 5.8,</p>
<p>and a normal thyroid panel. We will be initiating treatment for her</p>
<p>hyperlipidemia with Crestor 10 mg daily. She continues to complain of lower</p>
<p>extremity heaviness, aching and swelling despite compliance with compression</p>
<p>stocking therapy during the day, resting and elevating her legs at night</p>
<p>without significant symptom relief. We will arrange for RGSV ablation therapy</p>
<p>at her next visit. Risks, benefits, and alternatives were discussed in great</p>
<p>detail. We also discussed considering venogram of the RLE given her treatment</p>
<p>refractor edema as she has been compliant with conservative treatment therapy</p>
<p>including compression socks and diuretic therapy without significant symptom</p>
<p>relief. Educational material on venogram and May-Thurner syndrome were provided</p>
<p>to the patient on today's visit. She complains of lower extremity numbness and</p>
<p>cramping as well as pain, we will arrange for BLE arterial doppler on today's</p>
<p>visit. Preliminary images were reviewed and discussed revealing mild</p>
<p>atherosclerotic plaque and significant edema was also a noted finding. All</p>
<p>questions and concerns were answered and addressed. Heart healthy diet and</p>
<p>healthy lifestyle encouraged and endorsed. She is to follow up in 1 week or</p>
<p>sooner should symptoms worsen. She agrees to the plan of care</p>

<p>Transition of Care</p>
<p>This is a 62-year-old female, former smoker, non-ETOH user, with a significant medical history of COPD (oxygen dependent after RSV in December 2024), HLD, history of SVT, currently on diltiazem and metoprolol as well as a history of pulmonary nodules, following with Dr. Park, who presents today for CV follow up for lower extremity edema. She continues to complain of lower extremity heaviness, aching and swelling. She completed routine labs at her last visit which she would like to review and discuss today. She was following with her PCP, Amanda Hanson, at MMPC and saw a pulmonologist, Dr. Park. She reports undergoing chest x-ray at MMPC revealing bilateral atelectasis without any evidence of consolidation. She reports dissatisfaction with her plan of care provided by her prior primary care provider and pulmonologist and believes that her concerns are not adequately addressed and is seeking second opinion and more comprehensive evaluation and treatment plan and desires a collaborative approach to her ongoing medical management. She has undergone DEXA bone density scan testing in the past and reports a T-score of 2.4 indicating low bone mass indicating osteopenia. She reports that she is currently pending a chest CT on 12/12/25 with Dr. Park. She denies any active chest pain, chest pressure, syncope or near-syncopal events and continues to use supplemental oxygen therapy given her history of COPD.</p>
<p>Echocardiogram: Ejection fraction of 55% with trivial PB, mild MR and moderate TR.</p>
<p>Carotid doppler: Moderate atherosclerotic disease.</p>
<p>ABI/PVR: RLE of 1.07 and LLE of 1.24.</p>
<p>BLE venous reflux study: Negative for any evidence of DVT but bilateral significant reflux as well as edema noted.</p>
<p>CTA of the thorax: Severe pulmonary emphysema with multiple solid pulmonary nodules in the left upper lobe measuring up to 5 mm.</p>
<p>BLE arterial doppler: Mild atherosclerotic plaque and significant edema.</p>
<p>DEXA bone density test: T-score of 2.4 indicating low bone mass (osteopenia)</p>
<p>On physical examination, the patient has lower extremity edema, worse in her RLE. We will arrange for CDT of BLE on today's visit. Given her dissatisfaction with her current pulmonology care, we will be referring her to Dr. Bezdicek and we discussed further evaluation of her findings on recent chest x-ray and possible biopsy should it be needed. We reviewed and discussed her routine labs completed at her last visit revealing an LDL of 145, a hemoglobin A1c of 5.8, and a normal thyroid panel. We will be initiating treatment for her hyperlipidemia with Crestor 10 mg daily. She continues to complain of lower extremity heaviness, aching and swelling despite compliance with compression stocking therapy during the day, resting and elevating her legs at night without significant symptom relief. We will arrange for RGSV ablation therapy at her next visit. Risks, benefits, and alternatives were discussed in great detail. We also discussed considering venogram of the RLE given her treatment refractor edema as she has been compliant with conservative treatment therapy including compression socks and diuretic therapy without significant symptom relief. Educational material on venogram and May-Thurner syndrome were provided to the patient on today's visit. She complains of lower extremity numbness and cramping as well as pain, we will arrange for BLE arterial doppler on today's visit. Preliminary images were reviewed and discussed revealing mild atherosclerotic plaque and significant edema was also a noted finding. All questions and concerns were answered and addressed. Heart healthy diet and healthy lifestyle encouraged and endorsed. She is to follow up in 1 week or sooner should symptoms worsen. She agrees to the plan of care</p>
