(prediabetes)
> or =6.5%  Consistent with diabetes
This assay result is consistent with a decreased risk
of diabetes.
Currently, no consensus exists regarding use of
hemoglobin A1c for diagnosis of diabetes in children.
According to American Diabetes Association (ADA)
guidelines, hemoglobin A1c <7.0% represents optimal
control in non-pregnant diabetic patients. Different
metrics may apply to specific patient populations.

diabetes:
<5.7%       Consistent with the absence of diabetes
5.7-6.4%    Consistent with increased risk for diabetes
(prediabetes)
> or =6.5%  Consistent with diabetes
This assay result is consistent with a decreased risk
of diabetes.
Currently, no consensus exists regarding use of
hemoglobin A1c for diagnosis of diabetes in children.
According to American Diabetes Association (ADA)
guidelines, hemoglobin A1c <7.0% represents optimal
control in non-pregnant diabetic patients. Different
metrics may apply to specific patient populations.

The patient's chronic pain is likely multifactorial, stemming from his
history of spinal fusion, degenerative changes, and ongoing musculoskeletal
issues. His pain is currently being managed with Percocet every 12 hours as
needed. We discussed the continuation of this regimen while also exploring
additional pain management techniques, including interventional options if
necessary. A referral to pain management has been placed for further evaluation
and optimization of his treatment plan. BMP was checked, and no signs of abuse
were noted. The patient has been educated on the potential side effects of
Percocet, including risks of dependency and long-term opioid use. We also
discussed the possibility of further neurosurgical evaluation should his
symptoms progress or fail to respond to conservative management.
Patient was informed of the telemedicine visit by our office staff. Telemedicine was described in detail to the patient as the use of synchronous video and audio communication to provide clinical care from a distance. A telemedicine visit can provide the same medical standard of care for specific conditions. The patient was informed that the practice staff located at the provider's office would assist in carrying out any recommendations and clinical care.
Patient Location: Home
Lack of strict HIPPA Rules. Patient expressed verbal interest in the telemedicine visit and granted consent to proceed.

For
his lightheadedness and dizziness, we will obtain a carotid doppler.
Preliminary results reviewed and discussed with patient show moderate-to-severe
plaque bilaterally right greater than left. For his chronic pain, we will
refill his oxycodone today as well as reinitiate his gabapentin which he has stopped.
We will start him at 300 mg 3 times a day. The patient has a history of spinal
fusion and has chronic lumbar pain with radiculopathy. Due to his need for dual
antiplatelet therapy, it is not recommended that he take chronic NSAIDs. We discussed
possibly starting physical therapy for his chronic pain; however, patient
states due to his high co-pay he is not able to afford that. His prescription
monitoring is consistent with use, his reference number is 219478979. The patient
reports he also quit smoking 1 month ago and has not restarted. We discussed
and reviewed his recent sleep apnea testing which showed patient is negative
for any obstructive sleep apnea, and the study was of good quality. All
questions and concerns answered and addressed. A heart-healthy diet and
lifestyle encouraged and endorsed. We will see patient back in 1 month or
sooner. He agrees with plan of care.

Transition of Care
This is a 60-year-old male, current smoker, with significant medical history of emphysema, migraines, HLD, PAD, chronic pain syndrome and fibromyalgia, who presents today for CV follow-up for evaluation of her symptoms of chest discomfort. He also has a history of chronic pain syndrome and fibromyalgia. He said that he was on Percocet by his primary care physician at Middletown Medical. He wants to change his primary care over with us as well and wants to Percocet to be prescribed for chronic pain syndrome and chronic back pain. He said that two days back he had an episode of chest discomfort and he had to take sublingual nitroglycerin and his pain was alleviated with sublingual nitroglycerin. He denies any shortness of breath, syncope or near syncopal events.
We are going to renew his Percocet 5 mg every eight hours p.r.n. He is also pending a cardiac catheterization in two days for his abnormal stress test. We discussed with his wife, Sharon in the room as well. We are going to arrange for cardiac catheterization in two days, right and left heart cardiac catheterization. Follow-up as scheduled or sooner if any symptoms arise. Heart healthy diet and healthy lifestyle encouraged and endorsed. All questions and concerns were answered and addressed.

He reports waking up with a very tender, warm lump to his left calf. He states that it has been there and he feels it is worsening. He reports it is worsening in regard to surrounding redness and very tender to touch. He denies any injury or trauma to the leg. He also reports ongoing ache, heaviness, and fatigue to his legs as well along with itching to his legs. He denies any chest pain, chest pressure, shortness of breath, syncope, or near-syncopal events.
R/L Cardiac Cath 05/14/24: Non-obstructive CAD; normal LVEDP; normal PAP; LAD 1st diagonal branch 50% stenosed
Cardiac catheterization 05/20/2024: Non-obstructive CAD.
Peripheral angiogram, 04/26/2024 right pedal access: RSFA 80% stenosis status post balloon angioplasty of RSFA.
Peripheral angiogram 06/12/2024, left anterior tibial artery access: LSFA 70% stenosis, LPA 80% stenosis, LATA 80% stenosis.
Ultrasound: Non-vascular tissue lump which appears to possibly be cellulitis possibly from a potential bite.
Venous reflux images: Significant bilateral GSV reflux
For his leg ache, heaviness, and fatigue, plan will be to arrange for BLE venous reflux study today. We will also arrange for a soft tissue ultrasound on what appears to be a hardened, tender lump to his left calf. Preliminary images of LLE soft tissue ultrasound reveal a non-vascular tissue lump which appears to possibly be cellulitis possibly from a potential bite. We will start him on doxycycline. He was advised to avoid direct sunlight. Preliminary venous reflux images reviewed and discussed revealing significant bilateral GSV reflux noted. He was encouraged use compression stockings during the day, rest and elevate his legs at night. For his intermittent fatigue, we will arrange for cardiac rehab for him as well. All questions and concerns were answered and addressed. Heart healthy diet and healthy lifestyle encouraged and endorsed. He reports having a pain management consultation with Dr. Weinstein on 07/03/24, which he was encouraged to keep his appointment. We will see him back in 1 to 2 weeks or sooner if symptoms arise. He agrees to the plan of care.

This is a 60-year-old male, current smoker, with significant medical history of emphysema, migraines, HLD, PAD, who presents today for CV follow-up to discuss his cardiac catheterization. He states that he still has on and off symptoms of chest discomfort. He had a stress test done recently which showed possible anterior wall ischemia. He reports discomfort comes on at random, but is also noted with exertion. He reports improvement in his chest discomfort with rest. He does also leg discomfort with associated cramping in his legs more noticeable with ambulation. He is unable to walk farther than 20 to 30 feet without requiring frequent rest periods. He also ambulates with the assistance of a cane at times as well. He denies any active chest pain, chest pressure, shortness of breath at rest, syncope or near syncopal events. He denies any wounds or ulcers to his legs or feet.
EKG: Sinus rhythm, non-specific ST-T changes
ABI/PVR: RLE 0.6, LLE 0.37
Carotid Doppler: No significant ICA stenosis, moderate plaque noted.

This is a 61-year-old male with a significant medical history of emphysema, migraines, HLDP, chronic pain syndrome, and fibromyalgia. His past surgical history includes spinal fusion in 2001 and bilateral hip replacement approximately five to seven years ago. He is a smoker which may contribute to his ongoing musculoskeletal and vascular concerns. He presents for follow-up regarding chronic lower back pain and associated right foot numbness. His pain has persisted despite previous conservative management, and he was referred to a neurosurgeon. However, surgical intervention is deferred at this time due to his current medical history.
R/L Cardiac Cath 05/14/24: Non-obstructive CAD; normal LVEDP; normal PAP; LAD 1st diagonal branch 50% stenosed
Cardiac catheterization 05/20/2024: Non-obstructive CAD.
Peripheral angiogram, 04/26/2024 right pedal access: RSFA 80% stenosis status post balloon angioplasty of RSFA.

Ultrasound: Non-vascular tissue lump which appears to possibly be cellulitis possibly from a potential bite.
Venous reflux images: Significant bilateral GSV reflux
Echocardiogram: No significant valvular abnormality, preserved ejection fraction.
ABI/PVR: RLE 0.50 and LLE 0.28
Arterial doppler: Moderate atherosclerotic plaque in bilateral lower extremity arteries with patent flow.
The patient's chronic pain is likely multifactorial, stemming from his history of spinal fusion, degenerative changes, and ongoing musculoskeletal issues. His pain is currently being managed with Percocet every 12 hours as needed. We discussed the continuation of this regimen while also exploring additional pain management techniques, including interventional options if necessary. A referral to pain management has been placed for further evaluation and optimization of his treatment plan. BMP was checked, and no signs of abuse were noted. The patient has been educated on the potential side effects of Percocet, including risks of dependency and long-term opioid use. We also discussed the possibility of further neurosurgical evaluation should his symptoms progress or fail to respond to conservative management.
