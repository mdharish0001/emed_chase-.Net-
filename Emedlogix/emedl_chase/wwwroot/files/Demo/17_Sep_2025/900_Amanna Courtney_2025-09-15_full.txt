Lyme immunoblot testing should only be performed on
samples from patients who have had a Positive or
Equivocal result in a screening assay.
As per CDC criteria, a Lyme disease IgG Immunoblot must
show reactivity to at least 5 of 10 specific borrelial
proteins to be considered positive; similarly, a
positive Lyme disease IgM immunoblot requires
reactivity to 2 of 3 specific borrelial proteins.
Although considered negative, IgG reactivity to fewer
specific borrelial proteins or IgM reactivity to only
1 protein may indicate recent B. burgdorferi infection
and warrant testing of a later sample. A positive IgM
but negative IgG result obtained more than a month
after onset of symptoms likely represents a false-
positive IgM result rather than acute Lyme disease.
In rare instances, Lyme disease immunoblot reactivity
may represent antibodies induced by exposure to other
spirochetes.

Currently, no consensus exists regarding use of
hemoglobin A1c for diagnosis of diabetes in children.
According to American Diabetes Association (ADA)
guidelines, hemoglobin A1c <7.0% represents optimal

Her
blood pressure is mildly elevated on today's visit with a blood pressure of
140/90 with a heart rate of 90 beats per minute. We will be refilling her
olmesartan for her at this time and advised to maintain compliance to her
antihypertensive regimen. We discussed arranging for repeat blood pressure
check at her next visit and possibly consider titrating her antihypertensive
regimen given her uncontrolled blood pressure. We reviewed and discussed her
prior echocardiogram, which was completed for shortness of breath on exertion
revealing an EF of 55%, trace AR, mild TR and trace MR. All questions and
concerns were answered and addressed. Heart healthy diet and healthy lifestyle
encouraged and endorsed. She is to follow up in 4 weeks or sooner should
symptoms worsen. She agrees to the plan of care

Routine
lab work was drawn on today's visit for an assessment of her overall
health as well as apolipoprotein B and lipoprotein A without complication.
We will review and discuss the results at next visit. An EKG was completed
on today's visit for further evaluation of her overall cardiovascular
rhythm revealing sinus rhythm with a septal myocardial infarction. An
echocardiogram was completed on today's visit for further evaluation of her
shortness of breath upon exertion. Preliminary images reviewed and discussed
revealing a preserved ejection fraction. For further ischemic evaluation of her
significant shortness of breath upon exertion greatly affecting her daily
performance and exercise tolerance, we will arrange for coronary stress
testing to be completed at her next visit. Risk, benefits, and
alternatives were discussed in great detail. To evaluate for possible carotid
stenosis causing her episodes of dizziness and lightheadedness, a carotid doppler
was completed on today's visit. Preliminary images reviewed and discussed
that revealed mild atherosclerotic plaque. For the numbness and tingling in her
bilateral lower extremities, an ABI/PVR was completed today revealing an RLE of
1.03 and an LLE of 0.25. For her significantly abnormal ABI/PVR, giving
her numbness and tingling she experiences in her bilateral lower extremities, a
complete arterial doppler will be completed at her next visit. We placed an
event monitor on her today for further evaluation of her SVT. We will be
referring her to Elizabeth Jahn at Horizon Medical for a gynecological
evaluation. We will also be providing her with a script to obtain a
bilateral screening mammogram as she is not up to date. We will be
referring her to Dr. Siegel for a screening colonoscopy as she is not
up-to-date. We reviewed and discussed her current medication list. At this
time, we will be refilling her Olmesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 40/12.5 mg.
Side-effects discussed in great detail. We encouraged her to maintain an at
home blood pressure log for us to review in office for further management of
her hypertension. All questions and concerns were answered and addressed. A
heart-healthy diet and healthy lifestyle was encouraged and endorsed. She is to
follow-up in 4 weeks or sooner should symptoms worsen and progress or new
symptoms arise. She agrees to the plan of care.

were reviewed and discussed today that showed
an LDL of 129 and an A1C of 5.0. Thyroid function, CMP, hepatic
panel, lipoprotein a, CBC, vitamin D, and apolipoprotein B were
reviewed and found to be within normal limits. Lyme panel was
negative. Due to the mild elevation in LDL, she was advised to adopt
a diet low in saturated fats and high in fiber, as well as to
increase aerobic exercise. A repeat lipid panel is recommended in 3-6
months to assess response to lifestyle modifications. Follow-up is
scheduled for 07/21. She is in agreement with the plan of care.
