Given
her persistent lower extremity heaviness, aching, and swelling as well as
itching and burning at the sites of bulging varicosities despite compliance
with compression stocking therapy for over 6 months without significant symptom
relief, we will arrange for LSSV ablation therapy on today's visit. Risks,
benefits, and alternatives were discussed in great detail. All questions and
concerns were answered and addressed. Heart healthy diet and healthy lifestyle
encouraged and endorsed. She is to follow in 1 week or sooner should symptoms
worsen. She agrees to the plan of care

Given
recent LSSV ablation, we will arrange for a venous doppler of the LLE.
Preliminary images were reviewed and discussed, which were negative for any
evidence of DVT. She complains of persistent lower extremity heaviness, aching
and swelling as well as itching and burning at the sites of bulging
varicosities despite compliance with compression socks during the day, resting
and elevating her legs at night. We will obtain authorization for
below-the-knee venous ablation. Risks, benefits, and alternatives were
discussed in great detail. We will obtain authorization as she has remained
compliant with compression socks during the day, resting and elevating her legs
at night without significant symptom relief for over 6 months. All questions
and concerns were answered and addressed. Heart healthy diet and healthy
lifestyle encouraged and endorsed. She is to follow up in 2 weeks or sooner
should symptoms worsen. She agrees to the plan of care

On today's visit, we arranged for a
venous reflux study for further evaluation of her significant heaviness,
aching, swelling and restlessness in her BLE. Preliminary images were reviewed
and discussed that revealed a significant bilateral reflux with no evidence of
DVT as well as the possibility of May-Thurner syndrome and a possible cyst in
her groin area. We will seek authorization for a BLE arterial doppler for
further evaluation of the heaviness, aching, and cramping in her BLE. We will
also seek authorization for an echocardiogram to further evaluate her episodes
of shortness of breath upon exertion. We will seek authorization for a carotid
doppler for further evaluation of her episodes of dizziness and
lightheadedness. Upon physical examination, she was found to have decreased
pedal pulses for which we will seek authorization for an ABI/PVR at her next
visit. For her refractory edema despite conservative treatment therapy for over
6 months with no significant symptom relief and history of venous
insufficiencies, we will seek authorization for a lower extremity venogram to
be completed at her next visit. Risks, benefits, and alternatives were
discussed in great detail. She denies any allergies to contrast dye, upcoming
surgical interventions or renal impairment. We provided her with educational
material on venous insufficiencies, ablation therapies, venogram and
May-Thurner. We encouraged her to continue with compression stocking therapy
during the day, resting and elevating her legs at night. All questions and
concerns were answered and addressed. Heart healthy diet and healthy lifestyle
encouraged and endorsed. She is to follow up in 2 weeks or sooner should
symptoms worsen and progress or should new symptoms arise. She agrees to the
plan of care.
Time Spent:
Total time spent 84 minutes.  More than 50% of the time spent in
face-to-face conversation, examination, discussing treatment options and
procedures, pathophysiology, and anatomy. Diet and lifestyle modifications were
discussed in great detail.  Images were personally reviewed by me in front
of the patient and/or family member and explained on our graphic diagram.
Treatment options, risks, benefits and alternative treatments discussed
with the patient in detail. All questions and concerns answered.  All
records were reviewed in detail

We reviewed and discussed her venous reflux study, which reveals significant bilateral reflux with no evidence of DVT. For her significant lower extremity heaviness, aching, swelling, restlessness, itching, and burning at the site of bulging varicosities despite conservative treatment for over 6 months without significant symptom relief, we will arrange for LGSV venous ablation on today's visit. Risks, benefits, and alternatives were discussed in great detail. We encouraged her to continue with compression stocking therapy during the day and to rest and elevate her legs at night. All questions and concerns were answered and addressed. A heart-healthy diet and healthy lifestyle were encouraged and endorsed. She will follow up in 1 week or sooner if symptoms arise.

For
refractory edema despite conservative treatment therapy for over 6 months with
no significant symptom relief, we arranged for a venogram with left femoral
vein access for further evaluation of possible intervention of her left lower
extremity. Risks, benefits, and alternatives were discussed in great detail. She
denies any allergies to contrast dye, upcoming surgical interventions, or any
renal impairment. We encouraged her to continue with compression stocking
therapy during the day and with resting and elevating her legs at night. All
questions and concerns were answered and addressed. A heart-healthy diet and

For post venogram evaluation, we will arrange for an LLE venous doppler. Preliminary images were reviewed and discussed which was negative for any evidence of DVT. We reviewed and discussed her venogram, which was completed on 07/21, which revealed a luminal narrowing of the LCIV of 70% and LEIV of 50% s/p venoplasty. Upon physical examination, her access site is without any bleeding, drainage, hematoma, or other signs of infection. She was encouraged to complete her course of Plavix and to notify us of any abnormal bleeding or bruising. For shortness of breath on exertion, we will arrange for an echocardiogram on today's visit. Preliminary images were reviewed and discussed, which revealed a preserved ejection fraction of 55 to 60% with mild TR noted. Given complaints of lightheadedness and dizziness, we will arrange for a carotid doppler on today's visit. Preliminary images were reviewed and discussed, which revealed mild atherosclerotic disease. Upon physical examination, it is noted that she has decreased pedal pulses. We will arrange for an ABI/PVR which revealed an RLE of 0.36 and LLE of 0.67. We will arrange for an arterial doppler of the bilateral lower extremities on her next visit for evaluation of her abnormal ABI/PVR. We reviewed and discussed her venous reflux study, which was completed at her prior visit, which revealed significant bilateral lower extremity reflux without evidence of DVT. For significant lower extremity heaviness, aching, and swelling despite conservative treatment therapy with compression socks during the day, resting and elevating her legs at night, we will arrange for an LGSV ablation therapy at her next visit. Risks, benefits, and alternatives were discussed in great detail. All questions and concerns were answered and addressed. A heart-healthy diet and healthy lifestyle encouraged and endorsed.

She reported slight discomfort, reported there is a slight throbbing feeling at the procedure site. The patient was reassured that this discomfort is an effect of the procedure. She was instructed to ice, wrap, and elevate the affected extremity to promote healing. She was also instructed to take over-the-counter Tylenol to address the pain. She was advised to give us a call or come into the office if the pain persists or progresses. She was also advised to refrain from heavy lifting for the next two days. Patient expressed understanding of post-procedure instructions. All questions and concerns were answered and addressed. A heart-healthy diet and healthy lifestyle was encouraged and endorsed.

Patient was informed of the telemedicine visit by our office staff. Telemedicine was described in detail to the patient as the use of synchronous video and audio communication to provide clinical care from a distance. A telemedicine visit can provide the same medical standard of care for specific conditions. The patient was informed that the practice staff located at the provider's office would assist in carrying out any recommendations and clinical care.
