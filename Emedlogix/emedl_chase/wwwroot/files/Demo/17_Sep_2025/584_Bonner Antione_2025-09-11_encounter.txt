at his last visit was found to be 6.6. We discussed for better glycemic
control, we will be increasing his Mounjaro to 10 mg SC weekly. Side effects
were discussed in great detail. All questions and concerns were answered and
addressed. Heart healthy diet and healthy lifestyle encouraged and endorsed. He
is to follow up in 1 to 2 weeks for a repeat blood pressure check or sooner
should symptoms worsen. He agrees to the plan of care.
