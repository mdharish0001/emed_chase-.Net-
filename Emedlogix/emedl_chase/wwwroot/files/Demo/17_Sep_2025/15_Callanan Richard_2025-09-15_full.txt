results in a Borrelia burgdorferi antibody screen
will be tested using a blot method. Positive or
equivocal screening test results should not be
interpreted as truly positive until verified as such
using a supplemental assay (e.g., B. burgdorferi blot).
The screening test and/or blot for B. burgdorferi
antibodies may be falsely negative in early stages
of Lyme disease, including the period when erythema

The total PSA value from this assay system is
standardized against the WHO standard. The test
result will be approximately 20% lower when compared
to the equimolar-standardized total PSA (Beckman
Coulter). Comparison of serial PSA results should be
interpreted with this fact in mind.
This test was performed using the Siemens
chemiluminescent method. Values obtained from
different assay methods cannot be used
interchangeably. PSA levels, regardless of
value, should not be interpreted as absolute
evidence of the presence or absence of disease.

NOT DETECTED
Antimicrobials, proton pump inhibitors, and bismuth
preparations are known to suppress H. pylori, and
ingestion of these prior to H. pylori diagnostic testing
may lead to false negative results. If clinically
indicated, the test may be repeated on a new specimen
obtained two weeks after discontinuing treatment.
However, a positive result is still clinically valid.

We will arrange for routine blood work
to be completed on today's visit for assessment of overall health as well as
apolipoprotein B and lipoprotein A for assessment of genetic predisposition to
hyperlipidemia. We will arrange for H. pylori testing on today's visit given
his complaints of epigastric chest burning and discomfort which he described as
heartburn. We will arrange for an EKG at his next visit for evaluation of his
chest pain. For further evaluation of his chest pain and discomfort, we will
arrange for echocardiogram on today's visit. Preliminary images were reviewed
and discussed revealing a preserved ejection fraction of 55% to 60% with mild
TR noted. We will arrange for further ischemic evaluation of his chest pain
with ETT and coronary stress testing with Lexiscan at a future visit. On
today's visit, we will arrange for carotid doppler given his given recent TIA.
Preliminary images were reviewed and discussed revealing mild atherosclerotic
disease. He complains of leg pain and discomfort. We will arrange for an
ABI/PVR at his next visit as well as BLE arterial doppler. Given his lower
extremity heaviness and swelling towards his feet, we will arrange for venous
reflux exam on today's visit. Preliminary images were reviewed and discussed
which were negative for any DVT but positive for BLE reflux. We will arrange
for an event monitor to be placed given recent TIA and complaints of chest
pain. We will obtain hospital records from Barnabas Community Hospital in Toms
River given his recent hospitalization. All questions and concerns were
answered and addressed. Heart healthy diet and healthy lifestyle encouraged and
endorsed. He is to follow up on Monday or sooner should symptoms worsen. He
agrees to the plan of care.

Transition of Care
This is a 43-year-old male, non-smoker, with a significant medical history of depression and mood disorder for which he follows with his psychiatrist, Dr. Al-Tariq, who presents today for CV follow-up for review of blood work results as well as complaints of headaches. The patient reports significant headaches that began last week on Thursday. He reports that his headaches are primarily right-sided and last all day. His headaches are reportedly throbbing in nature, and he has trialed over-the-counter tension headache medicine with temporary relief of his symptoms. He denies any vision changes associated with his headaches. He does report intermittent episodes of dizziness associated with his headaches. At his previous visit, we arranged for routine labs for assessment of his overall health, which we will review and discuss at today's visit. We also previously initiated Crestor 20 mg for management of his hyperlipidemia, which he reports tolerating well without any ill side effects. We also previously arranged for an MCT monitor to be placed due to history of palpitations as well as recent TIA. We will review and discuss results at today's visit. The patient also reports intermittent lower extremity numbness and tingling. The patient previously reported chest pain that was associated with his TIA about 2 weeks ago. He complains of ongoing dull chest pain and discomfort post-hospitalization. He denies any syncope or near syncopal events.
Echocardiogram: Preserved ejection fraction of 55% to 60% with mild TR noted.
Carotid doppler: Mild atherosclerotic disease.
BLE venous reflux study: Negative for any DVT but positive for BLE reflux.
MCT monitor: sinus rhythm 100% of the time.
Upon physical examination, his blood pressure today was found to be 142/86. At this time, we will initiate labetalol 100 mg BID for management of his elevated blood pressure with associated heart rate of 90 bpm. Side effects were discussed in great detail. During today's visit, we also reviewed and discussed results of his MCT monitor, which was significant for sinus rhythm 100% of the time. We will arrange for an EKG at his next visit for further evaluation of his cardiovascular health. For evaluation of his bilateral lower extremity numbness and tingling, we arranged for an ABI/PVR at today's visit which revealed RLE 1.36 and LLE 1.25. For further evaluation of his headaches, which have been significant since Thursday, we will arrange for blood work to include CBC and CMP. Blood was drawn without complications. We will review and discuss results at his next visit. For further evaluation of his headaches, as well as history of recent TIA 2 weeks ago, we will arrange for an MRI of his brain without contrast. Risks, benefits, and alternatives were discussed in great detail. For management of his hyperlipidemia, the patient was encouraged to remain compliant with Crestor 20 mg, which he has been tolerating well thus far. For further evaluation of his chest pain, we will arrange for ischemic evaluation with coronary stress testing with Lexiscan on 09/15. Risks, benefits, and alternatives were discussed in great detail. All questions and concerns were answered and addressed. A heart-healthy diet and healthy lifestyle were encouraged and endorsed. He will follow up in 1 week or sooner if symptoms arise. He agrees to the plan of care.

Carotid doppler: Mild atherosclerotic disease.
BLE venous reflux study: Negative for any DVT but positive for BLE reflux.
We will arrange for routine blood work to be completed on today's visit for assessment of overall health as well as apolipoprotein B and lipoprotein A for assessment of genetic predisposition to hyperlipidemia. We will arrange for H. pylori testing on today's visit given his complaints of epigastric chest burning and discomfort which he described as heartburn. We will arrange for an EKG at his next visit for evaluation of his chest pain. For further evaluation of his chest pain and discomfort, we will arrange for echocardiogram on today's visit. Preliminary images were reviewed and discussed revealing a preserved ejection fraction of 55% to 60% with mild TR noted. We will arrange for further ischemic evaluation of his chest pain with ETT and coronary stress testing with Lexiscan at a future visit.

This is a 43-year-old male, non-smoker, with a significant medical history of depression and mood disorder for which he follows with his psychiatrist, Dr. Al-Tariq, who presents today for CV follow up for headaches. He continues to complain of significant headaches that began approximately 2 weeks ago. His headaches are primarily right-sided and last all day. They are throbbing in nature. He has trialed over-the-counter tension headache medication with temporary relief. He denies any vision abnormalities. He does report intermittent episodes of dizziness associated with these episodic headaches. He has a history of recent TIA. A script was provided to the patient at his last visit to undergo an MRI of the brain without contrast for further evaluation of his headaches as well as recent TIA. Authorization was previously pending but was recently approved. He complains of ongoing dull chest pain and discomfort post-hospitalization. He denies any syncope or near-syncopal events.
Echocardiogram: Preserved ejection fraction of 55% to 60% with mild TR noted.
Carotid doppler: Mild atherosclerotic disease.
BLE venous reflux study: Negative for any DVT but positive for BLE reflux.
MCT monitor: sinus rhythm 100% of the time.
As he complains of ongoing dull chest pain and discomfort, we will arrange further ischemic evaluation with coronary stress testing with Lexiscan on today's visit. Risks, benefits, and alternatives to the diagnostic study were discussed in great detail. He was encouraged to complete his MRI of the brain without contrast for further evaluation of his headaches and history of recent TIA. All questions and concerns were answered and addressed. Heart healthy diet and healthy lifestyle encouraged and endorsed. He is to follow up in 1 week to review and discuss his Lexiscan results or sooner should symptoms worsen. He agrees to the plan of care.
