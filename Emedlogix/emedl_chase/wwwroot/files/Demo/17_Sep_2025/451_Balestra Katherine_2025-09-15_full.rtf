For someone without known diabetes, a hemoglobin\par
A1c value between 5.7% and 6.4% is consistent with\par
prediabetes and should be confirmed with a\par
follow-up test.\par
For someone with known diabetes, a value <7%\par
indicates that their diabetes is well controlled. A1c\par
targets should be individualized based on duration of\par
diabetes, age, comorbid conditions, and other\par
considerations.\par
This assay result is consistent with an increased risk\par

This assay result is consistent with a decreased risk\par
of diabetes.\par
Currently, no consensus exists regarding use of\par
hemoglobin A1c for diagnosis of diabetes in children.\par
According to American Diabetes Association (ADA)\par
guidelines, hemoglobin A1c <7.0% represents optimal\par
control in non-pregnant diabetic patients. Different\par
metrics may apply to specific patient populations.\par
Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes(ADA).\par
This test was performed on the Roche cobas c503 platform.\par
Effective 4/16/24, a change in test platforms from the\par
Abbott Architect to the Roche cobas c503 may have shifted\par
HbA1c results compared to historical results.\par
Based on laboratory validation testing conducted at\par
Quest, the Roche platform relative to the Abbott\par
platform had an average increase in HbA1c value of\par
< or = 0.3%. This difference is within accepted\par
variability established by the National Glycohemoglobin\par
Standardization Program. Note that not all individuals\par
will have had a shift in their results and direct\par
comparisons between historical and current results for\par
testing conducted on different platforms is not\par
recommended.\par

and Prasugrel) discussed and explained. Risks and benefit for each antiplatelet\par
therapy explained in great detail. Local complications at the site of catheter\par
insertion are among the most common problems seen after peripheral angiogram.\par
These problems may include acute thrombosis, nerve damage, distal embolization,\par
dissection, poorly controlled bleeding, hematoma, retroperitoneal hemorrhage,\par
pseudoaneurysm, or arteriovenous fistula. Other potentially serious\par
complications include allergic reactions, atheroembolism, and acute kidney\par
injury (contrast nephropathy). Vascular complications include access site and\par
retroperitoneal bleeding or atheroembolism. Stroke, which occurs at a rate of\par
about one to four per thousand. Other important complications include acute\par
kidney injury and anticoagulation-associated bleeding. In-hospital death, which\par
occurs at a rate around less than one percent. After patient expressed full\par
satisfaction, an informed consent was obtained.\par

This is a 70-year-old female, former smoker, with a medical history of HTN, HLD, venous insufficiency, and obesity, who presents today for initial consult with heaviness, achiness, numbness, and tingling of bilateral lower extremities and discoloration of her bilateral feet. She has significant reticular varicose veins to her bilateral lower extremities causing significant heaviness and achiness since the past few weeks. Since the past few months she has been compliant on compression stockings with minimal symptomatic relief.  Denies chest pain, chest pressure, palpitations, SOB, blurred or double vision, syncope or near syncopal events. Denies any family history of premature coronary artery disease or sudden cardiac death.\par
Today I am going to arrange for an ABI/PVR as she has more than 60 pack/year smoking history. If her ABIs are normal we will arrange for arterial doppler at the next visit. For her reticular, varicose, and spider veins I am going to arrange for a BLE venous reflux study. For her dizziness I am going to arrange for a carotid doppler as well.\par

She is tolerating tirzepatide well. We will continue with her current dose today. Tirzepatide 15 mg was administered SC to the right arm without complication. She understands that the long-term side effects of tirzepatide are not well known. She also understands the importance of ongoing caloric deficit for optimal weight reduction. We discussed increasing her hydration and her activity levels as well. She is eating a lot less but reports not having changed her eating habits. We discussed not just counting on the shots and instead maintaining diet modification, increasing her protein and vegetable intake, and decreasing her intake of processed and carbohydrate-rich foods. Zepbound was previously sent to her pharmacy but was not approved by her insurance. She would like to continue receiving the injections in our office. A heart-healthy diet and healthy lifestyle modifications were encouraged and endorsed. All questions and concerns were answered and addressed to complete understanding and satisfaction. We will see her back in 1 week or sooner, should symptoms arise. She agrees to the plan of care.\par
