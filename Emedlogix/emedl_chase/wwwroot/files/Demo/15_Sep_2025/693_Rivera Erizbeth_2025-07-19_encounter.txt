findings revealed A1C of 5.7, suggesting borderline prediabetes, and
LDL level of 123, indicating mildly elevated cholesterol. Thyroid
function panel, CMP, and vitamin D levels were all within normal
limits. We advised the patient to continue a heart-healthy diet and
to limit intake of complex carbohydrates to reduce progression to
diabetes. She was encouraged to maintain physical activity and
hydration. Given her lab trends, lifestyle interventions are
justified and medically necessary to prevent escalation to chronic
conditions. All questions and concerns answered and addressed. Heart
healthy diet and healthy lifestyle modifications were encouraged and
endorsed. Patient agreed with the plan of care.
Patient was informed of the telemedicine visit by our office staff. Telemedicine was described in detail to the patient as the use of synchronous video and audio communication to provide clinical care from a distance. A telemedicine visit can provide the same medical standard of care for specific conditions. The patient was informed that the practice staff located at the provider's office would assist in carrying out any recommendations and clinical care.
