History and Physical Notes : Transition of Care
History and Physical Notes : This is a 63-year-old female, former smoker, with a history of asthma, anemia, HLD, hypothyroidism and anxiety, who presents today for a cardiovascular follow up for congestion. She reports that about 3 days ago, she developed congestion in her chest. She reports to have taken Singulair, Mucinex and albuterol with minimal relief of her chest congestion. She feels as though her chest congestion was worse when she woke up this morning and is concerned for a bacterial infection. She saw her pulmonologist yesterday who encouraged her to continue with Singulair, Mucinex and albuterol use. She also reports that about 1 month ago, she developed a sinus infection treated with a course of antibiotics with improvement in her symptoms. The patient reports that she has had similar episodes of chest congestion in the past, which have required antibiotic therapy for management. She also reports a history of pneumonia and is concerned for development of pneumonia or other infection in her chest at this time. She denies any fevers, chills, headache, sore throat, or any ill contacts. She does report a cough with clear mucus production. The patient is requesting an antibiotic for her chest congestion at this time, which we will consider at today's visit. She continues to follow with Westchester Medical Center and Dr. Koren, ophthalmology for complicated blepharoplasty. Her follow up with the Westchester Medical Center Ophthalmology is on 09/03/25. She was also previously on Repatha for management of her hyperlipidemiawhich was self-discontinued due to mild rash. She denies any chest pain, chest pressure, shortness of breath, syncope or near-syncopal events.

History and Physical Notes : During today's visit, we arranged for a rapid COVID and flu test, which was negative. We also discussed the importance of her compliance with Singulair, Mucinex and albuterol considering her history of asthma. We encouraged her to continue to follow with pulmonology. At today's visit we will arrange for blood work to include CBC and CMP for evaluation of her overall health and reported chest congestion; we will also arrange for a repeat lipid panel for evaluation of her history of hyperlipidemia and possible adjustment of her pharmacological therapy. Blood was drawn without complications, we will review and discuss results at her next visit. The patient continues to request antibiotic therapy as she feels that this will clear her chest congestion. We discussed in great detail the risks associated with antibiotic therapy including but not limited to antibiotic resistance and side effects associated with antibiotic therapy. We also discussed managing her chest congestion conservatively with an increase in her fluid intake as well as rest and possibly steam therapy for her chest congestion. At this time, we will initiate Z-PAK with fluconazole for management of her chest congestion and prevention of yeast infection associated with antibiotic therapy. Side effects were discussed in great detail. She was encouraged to continue following with WMC and Dr. Koren given history of complicated blepharoplasty. All questions and concerns were answered and addressed. A heart healthy diet and healthy lifestyle were encouraged and endorsed. She is to follow up in 1 week or sooner should symptoms worsen or new symptoms arise. She agrees to the plan of care.
