History and Physical Notes : Transition of Care
History and Physical Notes : This is a 23-year-old male, non-smoker, referred by ZocDoc with a significant medical history of renal calculi, migraines as well as syncope, who presents today for initial CV consultation for an annual physical. He currently works as the kitchen staff with elderly care in Fishkill. He has no children and lives in Wappingers. He has not seen a PCP in the last 2 years. He has a significant family history of pancreatic cancer in his maternal grandmother. He has a past surgical history of appendectomy. He reports that his last episode of syncope was several years ago and he was diagnosed officially with vasovagal syncope at that time. He reports not exercising as much as he would like to, but tries to maintain a balanced diet and a regular sleep schedule. He is overall feeling well but has noted severe migraines developing over the last months. He also complains of hand tremors. He complains of mild shortness of breath and fatigue. He denies any active chest pain, chest pressure, syncope, or near-syncopal events.
History and Physical Notes : Echocardiogram: Preserved ejection fraction of 55% to 60% with mild TR noted.
History and Physical Notes : Carotid doppler: Trace atherosclerotic disease.
History and Physical Notes : ABI/PVR: RLE of 1.27 and LLE of 1.28.
History and Physical Notes : We will arrange for routine blood work on today's visit for assessment of overall health as well as apolipoprotein B and lipoprotein A for assessment of genetic predisposition to hyperlipidemia. Given his complaints of fatigue and history of syncope in the past, we will arrange for echocardiogram and EKG on today's visit. Preliminary images were reviewed and discussed revealing a preserved ejection fraction of 55% to 60% with mild TR noted. We will arrange for an ETT as well for further ischemic evaluation of shortness of breath on exertion. Given syncopal episodes in the past and complaints of migraines, we will arrange for a carotid doppler on today's visit. Preliminary images were reviewed and discussed which revealed trace atherosclerotic disease. We will arrange for an ABI/PVR given decreased pedal pulses on physical examination revealing an RLE of 1.27 and an LLE of 1.28. We will arrange for an event monitor to be placed on today's visit given history of syncopal episodes in the past. We will be referring him to ophthalmology for an eye exam as he is not up-to-date and complaints of migraines. We will also arrange for an MRI of the brain without contrast given his hand tremors and migraines. All questions and concerns were answered and addressed. Heart healthy diet and healthy lifestyle encouraged and endorsed. He is to follow up on Friday or sooner should symptoms worsen. He agrees to the plan of care
